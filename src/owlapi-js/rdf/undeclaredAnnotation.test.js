// OWL 2 Mapping to RDF Graphs admits an annotation assertion only where the
// predicate is a declared annotation property - the pattern carries the
// condition `AP(x) != e`. A document that annotates with an undeclared property
// therefore has triples that match no pattern, and strict mode is right to leave
// them unreconstructed.
//
// Real vocabularies annotate this way constantly. `spatial.rdf` states
// `<vs:term_status>testing</vs:term_status>` on sixteen properties and one class
// without declaring `vs:term_status` anywhere, and it declares no annotation
// property at all. Dropping those loses every annotation in the document.
//
// A literal object cannot belong to an object property, and a data property
// assertion would be nonsense on a class. An annotation assertion is the reading
// that keeps the statement while asserting nothing logically, which is what the
// pinned oracle produces.
