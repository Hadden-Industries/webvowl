// `rdf:type` is read as a class assertion once the object is not one of the
// typing terms, and the set of those terms covers the OWL vocabulary -
// `owl:Class`, `owl:ObjectProperty`, `owl:DatatypeProperty`,
// `owl:AnnotationProperty` and the rest - but omits the two RDF and RDFS terms
// that mean the same thing. `x rdf:type rdf:Property` was therefore
// reconstructed as `ClassAssertion(rdf:Property x)`, which makes `rdf:Property`
// a class.
//
// It cannot be one. `rdf:Property` and `rdfs:Class` are reserved vocabulary,
// and OWL 2 admits only `owl:Thing` and `owl:Nothing` from the reserved set as
// class names. Asserting an individual into `rdf:Property` also says something
// the document does not: these triples type a property, they do not place an
// individual in a class.
//
// `dc.rdf` is the case in the corpus. It types its fifteen elements
// `rdf:Property`, and the extra class node reached the rendering, where the
// pinned oracle draws no class at all.
