// `rdfs:subPropertyOf` is parsed by three patterns, one per property category,
// and each requires both ends to be in that category: `SubObjectPropertyOf`
// needs OPE(x) != e and OPE(y) != e, `SubDataPropertyOf` needs DPE on both, and
// `SubAnnotationPropertyOf` needs AP on both. A triple whose two ends sit in
// different categories therefore matches no pattern at all.
//
// It cannot be repaired by moving one end, because OWL 2 Mapping to RDF Graphs
// section 3.2.1 states that at most one of OPE(x), DPE(x) and AP(x) is defined
// for any x. Reading the super-property as an object property would define
// OPE(x) for an IRI that already has AP(x), which is precisely what that
// sentence forbids.
//
// `rdfs:label` is the case that matters in practice: the OWL 2 Structural
// Specification makes it a built-in annotation property, so AP(rdfs:label) is
// defined before any triple is read and no document can change that.
// `schemaorg.owl` states `schema:name rdfs:subPropertyOf rdfs:label` while
// declaring `schema:name` an `owl:ObjectProperty`, which promoted `rdfs:label`
// to an object property and drew it as a property node of its own.
//
// The declared category of the subject is what the specification makes
// authoritative, so it is kept and only the unparseable triple is discarded -
// the same resolution the 186 reclassified `schemaorg.owl` properties get.
