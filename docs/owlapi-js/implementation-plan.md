# Extract and Publish the `owlapi` Core Module from WebVOWL

> **Status:** Final architecture and implementation blueprint  
> **Research baseline:** 8 August 2026  
> **Package identity and versioning decision:** 25 August 2026 — publish the unscoped npm package `owlapi`; begin with the useful `0.1.0-alpha.0` prerelease under `next`, target the production-recommended initial-development `0.1.0` under `latest`, apply only §2.60's immutable-tag contingency to either coordinate, permanently avoid every consumed historical coordinate, and defer any post-zero version choice to a future stability-promotion decision.<br>
> **Canonical repository decision:** 23 August 2026 — `https://github.com/Hadden-Industries/owlapi` is the sole canonical source and release repository; WebVOWL consumes registry artefacts and does not retain a second maintained package tree.<br>
> **Contributor-governance decision:** 23 August 2026 — begin with explicit `AGPL-3.0-only` inbound=outbound; defer any CLA until an external copyrightable contribution exists, but prohibit merging the first such contribution until the contributor-rights model is separately confirmed.<br>
> **Copyright-ownership and succession decision:** 23 August 2026 — Maksym Shostak retains personal copyright in his existing `owlapi` contributions; assignment to HADDEN INDUSTRIES LTD is optional rather than a publication gate, company stewardship is stated separately from copyright ownership, and this implementation plan explicitly accepts sole-custodian npm/GitHub availability risk rather than pretending company identity transfers account control.<br>
> **Terminal-scope decision:** 25 August 2026 — this plan targets `owlapi@0.1.0` as the first Hadden Industries production release and normally completes only after that exact version is registry-verified and consumed by WebVOWL; solely if §2.60 abandons an immutable tag after an extraordinary post-tag/pre-publication deterministic failure, the next available same-surface patch becomes the first production release, while solely if §2.33 is triggered after publication, the first accepted corrective patch becomes the exact production cutover; the expected `0.2.0` semantic feature line is owned by `ontology-lifecycle-capability-implementation-plan.md`, while post-release W3C test-suite reporting is owned by `w3c-test-conformance-reporting-implementation-plan.md`; neither follow-on programme is a completion gate here.<br>
> **Public-API decision:** 25 August 2026 — production `0.1.0` exposes the Java-recognizable `owlapi`, `owlapi/apibinding`, `owlapi/model`, `owlapi/io`, and `owlapi/formats` entry points; RDF/JS parsing, graph policy, and OWL↔RDF translators remain internal engines behind manager, document, and format APIs; the public surface follows the disciplined zero-major compatibility policy in §2.27 rather than claiming post-zero stability.<br>
> **Namespace-registry and source-layout decision:** 23 August 2026 — except for the bare `owlapi` aggregate, every public npm subpath maps exactly to an explicitly approved `org.semanticweb.owlapi` package; public Java-compatible bindings have one canonical definition in that Java-shaped public namespace, while non-public engines use a cohesive JavaScript-oriented `internal/` tree rather than a duplicated Java-package mirror.<br>
> **Runtime-portability decision:** 23 August 2026 — public exports remain unconditional native ESM; genuine platform differences use source-level capability detection and a lazy private fallback, while package-level environment conditions require a demonstrated supported-runtime need.<br>
> **Release-integrity decision:** 24 August 2026 — every public version is published from one retained, reviewed tarball built and fully qualified by GitHub Actions at an exact accepted protected-`main` commit before its canonical signed annotated tag is created; that same tarball, its `SHA256SUMS`, the validated reproducible production-only CycloneDX 1.6 library SBOM, and the post-registry release-evidence manifest become immutable GitHub release assets after registry verification.<br>
> **Security-policy decision:** 24 August 2026 — GitHub private vulnerability reporting is the preferred `owlapi` channel and `security@haddenindustries.com` is the durable company-controlled fallback; public vulnerability reports are prohibited, Maksym Shostak is the sole responder required by this plan, and the project aims to acknowledge private reports within five working days without representing that target as an SLA.<br>
> **Community-governance decision:** 24 August 2026 — the canonical repository adopts Contributor Covenant 3.0 through a repository-only `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`; Maksym Shostak is the sole HADDEN INDUSTRIES LTD-appointed moderator required by this plan, private reports go only to `conduct@haddenindustries.com`, and additional or conflict-substitute moderators are post-plan governance rather than publication gates.<br>
> **Supported-environment decision:** 24 August 2026 — the initial package supports Node 22 and 24 through native ESM, uses Node 24 for release production, supports current baseline browser applications through both ordinary bundlers and an application-owned document import map, and separately supports bundled dedicated workers; all other runtimes and package managers receive an explicit support status rather than an inferred promise.<br>
> **Browser-floor decision:** 25 August 2026 — alpha tracks the moving `baseline widely available` query, while production `0.1.0` freezes the 0.1.x JavaScript feature ceiling by appending the actual release-freeze date to `baseline widely available on` and records the resolved browser-data inputs; package source is neither transpiled nor polyfilled.<br>
> **Package-artefact and zero-major-contract decision:** 25 August 2026 — publish the canonical readable native-ESM source directly with no duplicate `src/`→`dist/` build, generated JavaScript, minification or source maps; ship the bounded version-matched README/API/changelog/licence/notice/compatibility set; publish no TypeScript declarations for `0.1.0-alpha.0` or `0.1.0`; and make the registry-classified public surface, rather than private paths or incidental implementation details, the documented 0.1 compatibility contract: patches restore it, while material additions or incompatible corrections require a deliberate later zero-major feature line.<br>
> **npm-custody decision:** 24 August 2026 — Maksym Shostak's `maksymshostak` npm account performs the one-time unscoped-package bootstrap and remains the sole natural-person npm custodian required through this plan; the project tests organization-team access without treating it as human redundancy, prohibits shared npm identities, accepts the resulting single-person availability risk, and moves every later release to the exact repository's stage-only OIDC trusted publisher.<br>
> **Staged-candidate binding decision:** 24 August 2026 — the direct bootstrap uses one explicitly bounded, immediately revoked npm granular access token because staged publishing cannot create a new package; every later release stages the already-retained tarball through OIDC, downloads npm's immutable candidate before approval, proves its SHA-256 is byte-for-byte identical to that retained tarball, and binds the human approval record to the stage ID, package coordinate, distribution tag, source tag/commit and digest.<br>
> **Release-control toolchain decision:** 24 August 2026 — Phase 19 freezes exact Node 22/24, npm, SemVer, import-map, SBOM, schema, package-lint, Playwright, fixture-bundler, GitHub CLI and history-filter versions; npm tools run only from the repository lockfile through named scripts, non-npm executables are checksum-verified, the SBOM generator is isolated from its production-only subject tree, and any replacement is a separately reviewed exact configuration change.<br>
> **Workflow-trust-boundary decision:** 24 August 2026 — use separate read-only CI, manually dispatched late-tag release, maintenance and extended-test workflows; keep each release's retained artefact chain inside one serialized `release.yml` run; deny token authority by default; isolate npm OIDC, GitHub-release writes and maintenance issue writes in different least-privilege jobs; and forbid privileged execution or cross-workflow artefact promotion of untrusted pull-request content.<br>
> **GitHub-Action inventory decision:** 24 August 2026 — allow exactly five GitHub-maintained Actions at reviewed full commit SHAs; disable `setup-node`'s implicit npm cache everywhere; remove persisted checkout credentials; transport the three-file release candidate by exact same-run artefact ID with digest enforcement; and configure dependency review solely for newly introduced high/critical runtime vulnerabilities.<br>
> **Hosted-runner and shell decision:** 24 August 2026 — use only explicit GA `ubuntu-24.04` x64, `windows-2025` x64 and `macos-15` arm64 GitHub-hosted labels; build every release artefact only on Ubuntu/Node 24; qualify the installed tarball on both Node patches across Windows and macOS; run the three Playwright engines separately on Ubuntu; make Bash/PowerShell Core selection explicit; record each mutable runner-image identity as evidence; and consume no runner-preinstalled release tool.<br>
> **Automation-failure-semantics decision:** 24 August 2026 — protect `main` with one stable fail-closed `CI / required` aggregate plus CodeQL, place an equivalent `Release / qualified` aggregate directly before npm authority, disable required-matrix fail-fast/allow-failure behavior, give every job and vulnerable step an exact timeout, serialize each workflow with its approved cancellation/queue policy, retry only bounded idempotent reads, and reconcile an ambiguous external write before any renewed explicitly authorized mutation.<br>
> **Untrusted-contributor execution decision:** 24 August 2026 — require approval for every external contributor’s fork-workflow run; execute proposed code only through unprivileged `pull_request` CI with no secrets, OIDC, environment or write authority; quarantine fork-produced artefacts to that same run; treat event/external text as validated data rather than shell or workflow syntax; and make automatic log masking defense in depth rather than a substitute for narrow credential flow and incident revocation.<br>
> **Late-tag release-ordering decision:** 24 August 2026 — dispatch `release.yml` manually only at an accepted protected-`main` commit, complete every deterministic candidate gate before creating the immutable canonical tag, and for post-bootstrap releases also stage, download and byte-verify the retained tarball before that tag; the human then signs and pushes `v<version>` at the already-fixed commit, the same run verifies it before draft-release or public-promotion authority, and an extraordinary deterministic failure after that point abandons rather than moves the tag.<br>
> **Same-run human-handoff decision:** 24 August 2026 — pause the release chain through one no-secret/no-variable/no-OIDC `release-manual` environment restricted to protected `main`, with required reviewer approval, self-review permitted and `deployment: false`; use it once after human tag creation in every release and a second time after interactive staged promotion, retain authenticated review history as evidence, and never occupy a runner with tag/publication polling.<br>
> **Distribution-tag decision:** 25 August 2026 — prereleases use `next`; production-recommended `0.1.0`—or solely its §2.60 prepublication-abandonment successor—is the first version allowed to establish `latest`; `next` is removed after production verification whenever it would otherwise remain a stale pointer to an older prerelease; and only the §2.33 bad-release contingency may later move `latest` to the first accepted corrective patch.<br>
> **Repository-workflow decision:** 24 August 2026 — `main` is the only standing integration branch, short-lived pull requests squash to one curated commit, and branch plus `v*` tag rulesets protect accepted history; no second-person review is a completion gate in this plan, while any future independent-review rule requires a separate post-plan governance/configuration decision.<br>
> **Release-preparation decision:** 24 August 2026 — humans prepare each public version and its changelog in a dedicated release pull request; automation verifies and publishes the accepted commit but never authors version changes, commits, tags, or release notes.<br>
> **Dependency-maintenance decision:** 24 August 2026 — foundational runtime dependencies are exact-pinned and updated one at a time through all relevant gates; Dependabot proposes but never auto-merges dependency or full-SHA GitHub Actions updates, and accepted security corrections must reach a published package rather than stop at an update pull request.<br>
> **Bad-release-recovery decision:** 24 August 2026 — preserve immutable versions and release evidence, contain defective defaults through recorded distribution-tag/deprecation operations, and publish a new corrected version; unpublish only for an extraordinary confidentiality, malware, legal, or registry-directed incident with separate authorization.<br>
> **Dependency-audit decision:** 24 August 2026 — retain full-graph audit evidence, block high/critical production findings and release-path development findings, permit only demonstrably inapplicable time-bounded exceptions, and never apply an automatic audit fix to release inputs.<br>
> **Release-approval decision:** 24 August 2026 — every automated registry write waits at `npm-release`, and every human tag/publication continuation waits separately at `release-manual`; during this release programme the workflow initiator may supply either approval, while independent deployment review and GitHub's prevent-self-review control are not required.<br>
> **Release-signing decision:** 24 August 2026 — release tags are SSH-signed annotated tags verified against a versioned authorized-signer registry and GitHub's verification result; signer keys remain human-controlled and distinct from OIDC publication authority.<br>
> **Public-intake decision:** 24 August 2026 — GitHub Issues with structured forms and an engineering-focused pull-request template are the ordinary public channels; blank issues, Discussions, a generic support mailbox, and premature `CODEOWNERS` ceremony remain disabled or absent.<br>
> **Publish-channel-metadata decision:** 24 August 2026 — every release manifest, `npm-release` environment request, and explicit npm command names the same SemVer-derived channel: prereleases use `next`, accepted production versions use `latest`, and any disagreement blocks publication.<br>
> **Package-discoverability decision:** 24 August 2026 — publish one accurate OWL/ontology/RDF-focused description and keyword set, omit misleading reasoner/WebVOWL claims, and leave `funding`, contributor, maintainer, and author-email metadata absent until each has a genuine semantic purpose.<br>
> **Release-evidence-retention decision:** 24 August 2026 — treat Actions logs/artifacts as 90-day diagnostics, place a machine-readable evidence manifest in every immutable GitHub release, retain an append-only repository release record, and add later extended-test observations without rebuilding or rewriting a package release.<br>
> **Repository-scanning decision:** 24 August 2026 — enable low-maintenance CodeQL default setup plus required high/critical merge protection, secret scanning, and push protection; real secrets are rotated as incidents, and source-analysis exceptions remain distinct, justified, and time-bounded.<br>
> **No-telemetry decision:** 24 August 2026 — `owlapi` performs no telemetry, analytics, update checks, remote configuration, install pings, or diagnostic uploads; only an explicitly authorized ontology-import or JSON-LD-context request may perform outbound document retrieval.<br>
> **Package-entry-point decision:** 24 August 2026 — expose the five approved unconditional native-ESM roots through one exact `exports` map, with no `main`, `module`, `browser`, conditional, wildcard, extension-alias or `package.json` export that could create a second or accidental public boundary.<br>
> **Import-purity decision:** 24 August 2026 — require the complete package-owned production module closure to be side-effect-free on import, publish `sideEffects: false`, and treat any required import-time registration, I/O or global mutation as a release-blocking design defect.<br>
> **Development-tooling decision:** 24 August 2026 — keep `engines.node` as the consumer contract, use npm-native `devEngines` to require Node as the source runtime and exact npm `12.0.2` as the repository package manager, and introduce neither `engines.npm` nor a separate Corepack/`packageManager` authority.<br>
> **Reference-import-map-tooling decision:** 24 August 2026 — generate the application-owned reference map with exact `@jspm/generator@2.16.3`, the `jspm.io` provider, `production`/`browser`/`module` conditions and integrity metadata; test an integrity-verified local mirror in all required engines while keeping the provider a replaceable reference rather than a package runtime dependency.<br>
> **Release-artifact-tooling decision:** 24 August 2026 — generate a validated reproducible production-only CycloneDX 1.6 library SBOM with exact `@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm@6.0.1`, validate versioned Draft 2020-12 release evidence with exact `ajv@8.20.0` plus `ajv-formats@3.0.1`, keep tooling outside the production subject tree, and rely on immutable release attestation rather than a redundant evidence signature.<br>
> **Published-dependency-tree decision:** 24 August 2026 — publish the six exact direct runtime dependencies as ordinary library dependencies, keep `package-lock.json` repository-only, publish no shrinkwrap/bundled/peer/optional/override dependency authority, and verify both the locked release graph and the graph resolved by a lockless fresh consumer.<br>
> **Independent-package-lint decision:** 24 August 2026 — use exact-pinned `publint@0.3.24` as the present baseline, permit a later exact version only after the same tool-update review, run it in strict mode against the retained tarball before publication and the registry-downloaded tarball afterwards, and permit only narrow versioned, expiring warning exceptions rather than weakening the project-specific package gates.<br>
> **Third-party-material decision:** 24 August 2026 — maintain a schema-validated, human-reviewed third-party-material inventory for the exact production graph, release-relevant development material and copied/generated third-party files; render `NOTICE` according to what the `owlapi` tarball actually distributes; and require WebVOWL to review its separately bundled deployment scope rather than pretending one package notice covers both distributions.<br>
> **npm-provenance-verification decision:** 24 August 2026 — verify `owlapi@<version>` itself with npm's signature/attestation JSON, require its registry signature, provenance/publish attestations, subject digest, source/workflow identity and transparency evidence to agree, and retain a normalized root-package record rather than treating a badge or aggregate attestation count as proof.<br>
> **Immutable-release-verification decision:** 24 August 2026 — define `SHA256SUMS` as sorted lowercase SHA-256 entries for the retained tarball and SBOM, verify exact GitHub CLI `2.98.0` against its official binary checksum, and close each release only after a fresh download passes immutable-release verification, per-asset attestation checks, checksums, evidence-schema validation and independent signed-tag verification.<br>
> **Purpose:** Define the standards-grounded, migration-safe extraction of reusable OWL parsing and ontology-model functionality from WebVOWL into a standalone JavaScript core, normally publish `owlapi@0.1.0` as its first Hadden Industries production-recommended initial-development release under the narrowly bounded §2.60 prepublication-tag contingency, and prove the improved WebVOWL fork uses that production-verified npm package without a privileged source-tree path.

## Executive Summary

WebVOWL has accumulated substantial ontology parsing functionality that no longer belongs inside visualization-specific code. The current system accepts multiple ontology syntaxes, translates most of them through an RDF/XML intermediate representation, reparses that RDF/XML, and then mixes generic ontology interpretation with VOWL-specific extraction. This architecture has delivered working format support, but the intermediate representation and responsibility boundaries are now the principal source of accidental complexity.

The extraction should **not** simply move the existing parsers into a new directory and replace RDF/XML strings with arrays of triples. That would preserve the deepest architectural mistake while changing only its representation.

The correct architecture has **two distinct canonical intermediate representations**, because OWL and RDF are different abstraction layers:

1. **Canonical OWL representation:** a W3C-faithful **OWL 2 structural object model** (`OWLOntology`, axioms, class expressions, property expressions, annotations, entities, literals, etc.). This is the semantic/domain model exposed to WebVOWL and other OWL consumers.
2. **Canonical RDF representation:** an **RDF/JS `DatasetCore` of `Quad` objects**. This is the serialization-independent RDF boundary used for RDF syntaxes and for OWL↔RDF mapping.

The relationship is:

```

This is not an invented abstraction. The W3C OWL 2 Structural Specification explicitly defines a syntax-independent structural representation and states that it provides the foundation for OWL APIs and reasoners. The W3C Mapping to RDF Graphs defines the deterministic bridge between this structural representation and RDF. Java OWLAPI itself follows the same conceptual architecture: `OWLParser` implementations populate `OWLOntology` with axioms; `OWLRDFConsumer` reconstructs OWL objects from RDF triple patterns; and `AbstractTranslator` / `RDFTranslator` translate an `OWLOntology` back to an RDF graph.

The most important consequences for this refactor are:

- **Do not make triples the storage model of `OWLOntology`.** `OWLOntology` owns structural axioms and ontology metadata. RDF is a projection/boundary representation.
- **Do not make every parser emit RDF.** OWL-native syntaxes should construct the structural model directly. RDF syntaxes should produce RDF/JS quads and then pass through one shared RDF→OWL interpreter.
- **Do not make a universal RDF dispatcher such as `rdf-parse` a foundational abstraction.** `OWLOntologyManager` already owns parser selection. Each RDF syntax adapter should call the strongest narrowly scoped implementation directly and normalize immediately to RDF/JS, keeping third-party parser choice replaceable behind the `owlapi-js` boundary.
- **Do not use triples as the canonical RDF type.** RDF/JS defines triples as quads whose graph is `DefaultGraph`; quads preserve named-graph membership when source formats such as TriG or N-Quads contain it.
- **Do not put RDF named-graph state onto OWL axioms.** Graph membership is RDF dataset/source context, not a property of the OWL 2 structural model.
- **Delete RDF/XML as an internal interchange format.** RDF/XML serialization becomes an optional future output boundary, not a pipeline step.
- **Make structural equality a first-class implementation concern.** JavaScript `Set` and `Map` compare objects by identity, while OWL structural equivalence treats most associations as unordered duplicate-free sets. `owlapi-js` therefore needs canonical structural keys, interning, or equivalent explicit equality semantics.
- **Use the Java implementation as a behavioural oracle, not as a Java-to-JavaScript transliteration target.** Match OWL semantics and observable behaviour; adopt JavaScript-native async I/O, iterables, ESM packaging, immutable objects/configuration, and RDF/JS interoperability.
- **Migrate the ontology-ingestion programme sequentially.** Complete one WIP-locked ingestion migration, its acceptance gate and its learning/institutionalization handoff before the next begins; keep the Java differential corpus green subject only to precise approved expected differences.

The proposed end state is therefore a small, reusable OWL core with clean adapters, not a WebVOWL-specific parser bundle wearing an `owlapi` name. In this plan, **`owlapi` is the immutable public npm package name and root convenience entry point**. Java-recognizable subpaths expose the supported `apibinding`, `model`, `io`, and `formats` concepts; RDF/JS and OWL↔RDF machinery remains behind those APIs. The existing `src/owlapi-js/` and `docs/owlapi-js/` paths remain internal migration/source labels; they do not define the published package name and need not be renamed merely to make the npm identity match.

## 1. Background & Motivation

### 1.1 What is WebVOWL?

[WebVOWL](file:///C:/Users/maksy/GitHub/webvowl) is a JavaScript application that visualizes OWL ontologies using the VOWL (Visual Notation for OWL Ontologies) specification. Its high-level pipeline is:

1. **Accept** an ontology document in a supported syntax.
2. **Parse and interpret** it as an ontology.
3. **Convert** the ontology into VOWL-specific data.
4. **Export** VOWL-JSON.
5. **Render** the VOWL-JSON as an interactive graph in the browser.

The architectural objective of this refactor is to make steps 1–2 reusable and syntax-independent, while keeping steps 3–5 WebVOWL-specific.

### 1.2 What is Java OWLAPI?

The [Java OWLAPI](file:///C:/Users/maksy/GitHub/owlcs/owlapi) (`org.semanticweb.owlapi`) is the canonical mature Java API for manipulating OWL ontologies. Its relevant architecture is broader than “a collection of parsers”:

- a syntax-independent OWL object model (`OWLOntology`, `OWLAxiom`, `OWLClassExpression`, `OWLEntity`, `OWLLiteral`, annotations, etc.);
- an `OWLDataFactory` for constructing structural OWL objects;
- ontology managers and loading configuration;
- parser and parser-factory abstractions;
- RDF→OWL interpretation (`OWLRDFConsumer`);
- OWL→RDF translation (`AbstractTranslator` / `RDFTranslator`);
- format metadata, imports, IRI mapping, changes, renderers/storers, profiles, utility APIs, and reasoner interfaces.

For this project, **OWLAPI is both a behavioural oracle and a proven reference architecture**, but the initial `owlapi-js` scope is intentionally smaller than complete OWLAPI parity.

### 1.3 What WebVOWL has already built

The project has ported or implemented substantial parsing logic for:

- Manchester OWL Syntax;
- OWL Functional Syntax;
- OWL/XML;
- DL Syntax;
- KRSS2;
- Turtle;
- JSON-LD;
- RDF/XML processing/fallback logic.

A parser-surface audit against OWLAPI 5 revealed one important **compatibility gap that WebVOWL had not implemented**: original **KRSS / KRSS1**. OWLAPI exposes `KRSSOWLParser` (`org.semanticweb.owlapi.krss1.parser`) and `KRSS2OWLParser` (`org.semanticweb.owlapi.krss2.parser`) as distinct `OWLParser` implementations, with distinct KRSS and KRSS2 document-format factories. `owlapi-js` represents and implements KRSS1 explicitly as a `REQUIRED_V1` capability in Phase 17. Its distinct format identity and initial grammar-gap architecture were completed in Phase 11; Phase 17 adds the executable parser without turning KRSS2 into a generic KRSS alias. This gap is a useful warning: the authoritative parser inventory must come from OWLAPI itself, not only from the formats WebVOWL already happens to contain.

That work contains valuable, hard-won implementation knowledge. In particular, the existing differential corpus exposed silent language-tag loss, permissive-parser false positives, XML parser semantic differences, invalid blank-node serialization, unresolved XML entities, and catastrophic eager-tokenization memory behaviour.

The extraction must preserve those lessons rather than starting from an idealized parser rewrite.

### 1.4 Why extraction is now justified

The current parser code is reusable domain infrastructure trapped inside a visualization module. Extraction provides four immediate benefits:

1. **Separation of concerns:** OWL syntax/semantics no longer depend on VOWL data structures.
2. **Elimination of format round-trips:** non-RDF/XML inputs no longer serialize to RDF/XML only to be parsed again.
3. **Single semantic model:** all syntax front ends converge on the same structural ontology representation.
4. **Independent validation and reuse:** parser correctness can be tested and released independently of WebVOWL rendering.

It also creates the nucleus of something currently missing from the JavaScript ecosystem: a modern, browser-capable, standards-oriented structural OWL API above RDF/JS.

### 1.5 Why a mature JavaScript OWLAPI equivalent does not already dominate the ecosystem

The absence of such a library is not evidence that the architecture is flawed. The historical incentives explain the gap:

- Java OWLAPI became mature early and anchored tooling such as Protégé and Java reasoners.
- JavaScript Semantic Web tooling standardized strongly at the **RDF** layer (RDF/JS, JSON-LD, SPARQL, SHACL, Comunica, etc.) rather than the OWL structural/direct-semantics layer.
- Full OWL 2 support is broad: constructing the classes is easy; faithfully implementing equality, RDF reconstruction, annotations, imports, corner cases, and all syntax forms is substantial work.
- A revealing historical project, `owljs`, offered JavaScript OWL manipulation but used RingoJS/Rhino to call **Java OWLAPI on the JVM** instead of recreating it natively.
- Modern JavaScript now has much stronger foundations—ES modules, mature browser/Node parity, RDF/JS, streaming parsers, workers, WebAssembly, and robust package tooling—than when earlier attempts were made.

The opportunity is therefore credible, but scope discipline is essential.

## 2. Architectural Principles and Non-Negotiable Decisions

### 2.0 Normative language, precedence and authoritative capability surface

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **NOT RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** in this document are to be interpreted as described in **BCP 14**, comprising RFC 2119 and RFC 8174, when, and only when, they appear in all capitals.

Lowercase variants are ordinary English and are not normative keywords.

When two parts of the migration material appear to conflict, authority is resolved in this order:

1. normative architectural requirements and non-negotiable decisions in this blueprint;
2. the authoritative initial-release capability/compatibility matrix;
3. the current phase execution contract;
4. the canonical parser-migration playbook;
5. historical per-migration lesson records;
6. illustrative examples, diagrams, pseudocode and explanatory prose.

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) records **why** a normative decision changed; it is not a hidden competing specification layer. If an ADR changes a normative requirement, every affected normative artefact **MUST** be updated in the same accepted change before implementation relies on the new rule.

Examples, diagrams, sample code and pseudocode are non-normative unless explicitly identified as normative.

An implementer **MUST NOT** locally resolve an unresolved question that changes public API, semantic behaviour, security policy, provenance policy, cross-phase contracts, capability scope or acceptance criteria.

#### Authoritative capability/compatibility matrix

The project **MUST** maintain one authoritative, machine-readable capability/compatibility matrix. Conceptually it belongs at a path such as:

```text
docs/owlapi-js/compatibility/capabilities.yaml
```

The exact serialization and filename **MAY** follow repository convention, but there **MUST** be exactly one normative machine-readable source.

Every relevant capability **MUST** have exactly one release-status classification:

```text
REQUIRED_V1
DEFERRED
UNSUPPORTED_BY_DESIGN
DELEGATED
```

A separate non-normative progress state such as `NOT_STARTED`, `IN_PROGRESS` or `COMPLETE` **MAY** be recorded, but implementation progress **MUST NOT** redefine release scope.

The matrix **MUST** cover at least:

- parsers and document formats;
- syntax/grammar constructs;
- structural object and axiom families;
- `OWLDataFactory` construction surface;
- RDF→OWL mapping;
- OWL→RDF mapping;
- public ontology and manager APIs;
- import/loading behaviour;
- graph/document policies;
- diagnostics and public errors;
- selected Java OWLAPI compatibility behaviour;
- known deviations.

No phase or implementation team **MAY** redefine the meaning of “supported” locally. A `REQUIRED_V1` capability remains required even when the current WebVOWL corpus does not exercise it. `DEFERRED` and `UNSUPPORTED_BY_DESIGN` capabilities **MUST NOT** become accidental public support merely because an implementation dependency happens to accept them.

Human-readable compatibility documentation **SHOULD** be generated from, or mechanically checked against, the authoritative matrix.

### 2.1 Decision: the OWL 2 structural model is the canonical OWL IR

The W3C structural specification is expressly independent of concrete syntaxes and defines the conceptual structure and structural equivalence of OWL 2 objects. The core library should model that abstraction directly.

Examples of first-class OWL objects include:

```text

A parser for an OWL-native syntax should create these objects—preferably through one `OWLDataFactory`—and add axioms/metadata to an ontology under construction.

### 2.2 Decision: RDF/JS `DatasetCore<Quad>` is the canonical RDF IR

At the RDF layer, use standard RDF/JS abstractions rather than project-specific `{subject,predicate,object}` records.

RDF/JS represents a triple as a quad with `DefaultGraph`:

```javascript
factory.quad(subject, predicate, object, factory.defaultGraph());
```

This makes the RDF representation a lossless common supertype for both:

- graph-only formats such as Turtle, N-Triples and RDF/XML; and
- dataset formats such as TriG and N-Quads where named graph membership carries additional information.

The selected v1 implementation dependencies are:

- `@rdfjs/data-model` — canonical RDF/JS term and quad factory;
- `@rdfjs/dataset` — canonical `DatasetCore` implementation;
- `n3` / N3.js — v1 parsing implementation for **Turtle, TriG, N-Triples and N-Quads**;
- `rdfxml-streaming-parser` — v1 RDF/XML parser emitting RDF/JS quads;
- `jsonld` / Digital Bazaar `jsonld.js` — v1 JSON-LD processor, adapted directly to RDF/JS without an intermediate N-Quads serialization.

The broader **Notation3 (N3) language is `DEFERRED` for v1**. The presence of N3.js as a dependency **MUST NOT** be interpreted as a claim of N3-language support.

Do **not** introduce a second universal parser-dispatch framework underneath `OWLOntologyManager`. Parser selection, format hints, bounded detection, priority and fallback semantics are already core responsibilities of `owlapi-js`; duplicating them through `rdf-parse`, Comunica or another nested dispatcher adds indirection without semantic value.

All third-party parsers are replaceable implementation details behind `owlapi-js` adapters. No parser-specific term classes, streams, exceptions, parser instances or configuration objects **MAY** leak into either the public OWL API or the package-internal canonical RDF boundary.

### 2.3 Decision: OWL and RDF are two models connected by translators

Do not collapse these two layers into one “universal” internal model.

```text
OWL structural model  ←→  RDF/JS dataset
       semantic              interchange/
       ontology              graph layer
```

The library should have explicit components such as:

```text
OwlToRdfTranslator
RdfToOwlTranslator   (or OWLRDFConsumer-equivalent)
```

These are reusable semantic bridges, not syntax-specific serializers.

### 2.4 Decision: `OWLOntology` does not store raw triples as its source of truth

The earlier plan proposed storing/indexing raw triples inside `OWLOntology` and exposing semantic accessors over them. That should be rejected.

Instead:

```text
OWLOntology
    owns
      ↓
Set/Index of OWLAxiom structural objects
      ↓
derived signature/indexes/caches
```

An RDF view may be generated lazily or cached when required:

```text
OWLOntology
    ↓ OwlToRdfTranslator
DatasetCore<Quad>
```

This makes OWL-native syntax parsing direct, prevents RDF encoding details from leaking into domain APIs, and mirrors OWLAPI's observable architecture.

### 2.5 Decision: behavioural compatibility, not mechanical Java transliteration

Names that are already idiomatic and useful should align with Java OWLAPI (`OWLManager`, `OWLOntology`, `OWLDataFactory`, `OWLParser`, `IRI`, etc.). However:

- Java overloads should become optional parameters or explicit JavaScript methods;
- network/document loading should be asynchronous;
- Java `Stream` APIs should map to JavaScript iterables/sets/arrays where appropriate;
- immutable configuration should use copy/`with...` patterns;
- ESM packaging should expose only registry-approved Java package mappings rather than mirroring the entire Java source tree or its implementation packages;
- Java interface hierarchies should not be reproduced merely for nominal type ceremony.

The compatibility goal is **semantic and behavioural parity for the `REQUIRED_V1` capability surface**, not line-for-line class hierarchy parity.

### 2.6 Decision: no RDF/XML internal round-trip

The following pattern becomes an explicit anti-pattern:

```text
syntax
  ↓
triples/AST
  ↓
RDF/XML string
  ↓
DOM
  ↓
triples/ontology data
```

The new pipeline must never require RDF/XML merely because an old downstream module accepts XML.

### 2.7 Decision: named graph context is not an OWL axiom property

An OWL axiom belongs to an **ontology**. RDF named-graph membership belongs to an **RDF dataset**.

Do not add fields such as:

```javascript
axiom.graph = ...; // wrong abstraction
```

If named graph/source context matters, preserve it alongside the ontology or dataset in document/load context.

### 2.8 Decision: parser output must not silently discard unsupported constructs

Historical code sometimes recognized a construct during dispatch but returned `null` when rendering it. That is unacceptable in the extracted core.

The public parsing modes are exactly:

```text
strict
compatible
```

`strict` is the default core behaviour.

`compatible` exists only for parsers whose authoritative capability contract explicitly defines recovery behaviour. For each compatible parser, the accepted recovery cases, recovery action, emitted diagnostic and fatal cases **MUST** be specified before the behaviour is implemented.

Generic “catch and continue” recovery is forbidden. A syntactically recognized but unsupported construct **MUST** raise `UnsupportedConstructError` unless that exact construct/recovery case is explicitly permitted by the parser's compatible-mode contract.

Resource/security failures, cancellation, fatal I/O failures and internal invariant failures are always fatal under both modes.

A successful compatible recovery that changes, omits or approximates semantics **MUST** emit a structured diagnostic. The generic presence of `parsingMode: "compatible"` **MUST NOT** imply that every parser supports permissive recovery.

Never silently omit semantic content.

### 2.9 Decision: execute the finite ontology-ingestion programme sequentially

The major ontology-ingestion migrations **MUST** be executed one at a time for the complete finite v1 parser/adapter programme. There is no later “parallel parser migration” mode in this plan.

The mandatory cycle is:

```text
IMPLEMENT
  ↓
VERIFY
  ↓
INTEGRATE
  ↓
LEARN
  ↓
INSTITUTIONALIZE
  ↓
HAND OFF
  ↓
NEXT IMPLEMENTATION
```

Every completed migration **MUST** transfer its reusable lessons into the canonical migration playbook and, wherever practical to express deterministically, into executable tests/contracts/fitness checks before the next migration begins.

The architectural distinction remains absolute:

```text
OWL-native syntax → OWL structural model
RDF syntax        → RDF/JS DatasetCore<Quad> → RdfToOwlTranslator
```

But OWL-native and RDF syntaxes form **one cumulative ingestion-learning programme**. Syntax-local lessons **MUST** be tagged as such; cross-cutting lessons **MUST** be propagated to later phases.

The WIP lock applies to the explicitly enumerated ingestion sequence in §17, including the shared RDF→OWL hardening phase. Non-ingestion work such as CI, fixture acquisition, documentation, provenance work, benchmark tooling and unrelated WebVOWL work **MAY** proceed concurrently, provided it does not pre-implement the production semantics of a later ingestion phase.

Rolling-wave planning **MAY** refine the details or propose reordering of not-yet-started migrations, but it does not change the one-at-a-time WIP rule. Any reordering requires the project decision process defined in §17.

### 2.10 Decision: publish `owlapi`, beginning with `0.1.0-alpha.0` under `next`

The standalone core's public package identity is fixed as follows:

| Property | Normative value |
| --- | --- |
| Registry | npm public registry, `https://registry.npmjs.org/` |
| Package name | unscoped `owlapi` |
| Canonical source repository | `https://github.com/Hadden-Industries/owlapi` |
| Intended first public version | `0.1.0-alpha.0`; solely if its immutable tag is abandoned under §2.60 before publication, `0.1.0-alpha.1` |
| First distribution tag | `next` |
| Normal first production version | `0.1.0` under `latest`, only after Phase 20's release-candidate, public-package, WebVOWL-consumer and production-publication gates; solely if §2.60 abandons immutable `v0.1.0` before publication, `0.1.1` after the same complete gate |
| First planned feature line | the next available zero-major feature coordinate, expected to be `0.2.0` and owned by `ontology-lifecycle-capability-implementation-plan.md`; an intervening incompatible correction may consume that coordinate and advance the programme rather than forcing unrelated work together |
| Eventual post-zero version | deliberately unassigned; a future stability-promotion decision must audit the immutable history and choose an available coordinate, with `1.0.1` and `3.0.0` retained as options rather than deliverables of this plan |
| `0.1.0` public import roots | `owlapi`, `owlapi/apibinding`, `owlapi/model`, `owlapi/io`, `owlapi/formats` |
| First-party consumer boundary | WebVOWL declares `owlapi` as a production dependency and imports it only through those public roots |
| Module system | native ESM |

`owlapi-js` was considered as the public name because it was apparently unused,
but it is not selected. npm is already a JavaScript package ecosystem, and npm's
own package-name guidance advises authors not to add `js` or `node` merely to
identify the implementation language. `owlapi` is shorter, is the semantically
direct description of the library, and lets documentation use one canonical
consumer spelling. The `-js` suffix would distinguish the implementation from
Java OWLAPI in prose but would add no information to an npm import. Prose
**MUST** use “Java OWLAPI” for the Java project where ambiguity is possible.

The existing capability classification `REQUIRED_V1` continues to mean “required
for the first standalone release programme.” It is a historical capability
label, not an npm major-version promise, and does not make the unavailable
historical `1.0.0` coordinate part of this project. Capability status and
package versioning remain explicitly separate vocabularies.

Before Phase 19's repository handoff, this WebVOWL repository may continue to
use `src/owlapi-js/`, `docs/owlapi-js/` and the term “owlapi-js migration” as
internal historical/staging labels. After the handoff,
`Hadden-Industries/owlapi` owns the maintained package source and package-facing
documentation; retained WebVOWL history may still contain the old paths, but
the WebVOWL working tree **MUST NOT** retain a second maintained package copy.
Public metadata, examples and consumer tests **MUST NOT** expose `owlapi-js` as
an alternate package name or import alias. If npm does not initially accept
publication of `owlapi`, Phase 19 is blocked on diagnosis/namespace resolution;
an implementer **MUST NOT** switch to `owlapi-js`, a scope, or another spelling
without a new approved decision that updates every normative artefact.

#### 2.10.1 Prior unrelated npm history and empirical resolution evidence

The name previously identified an unrelated Overwatch-oriented package. Its
known public versions were:

```text
1.0.0
1.1.0
1.2.0
1.2.1
1.3.0
2.0.0
2.0.1
```

All of them have been unpublished. On 23 August 2026, installation probes used
npm 12.0.2 against the canonical public registry from an isolated prefix, with
lifecycle scripts, audit/funding output, dependency saving and lockfile creation
disabled. The observable results were:

| Requested specifier | Public-registry result |
| --- | --- |
| `owlapi` | `ENOVERSIONS`: no versions available |
| `owlapi@latest` | `ETARGET`: no matching `latest` version |
| each exact version from `1.0.0` through `2.0.1` listed above | `ETARGET`: no matching version |
| `owlapi@^1.0.0`, `owlapi@^2.0.0`, `owlapi@*` | `ENOVERSIONS`: no versions available |

No former tarball was installed and no live distribution tag resolved. This is
the evidence that ordinary public-registry consumers cannot currently receive
the old implementation and that an exact old dependency cannot silently become
the new OWL library.

Unpublishing does **not** erase npm's immutable `name@version` history. Every
exact version above is permanently consumed and **MUST NOT** be proposed for
this project. npm's documented collision rule is the immutable `name@version`
coordinate; it does not impose a documented monotonic floor above the former
highest version. The real publication attempt remains the conclusive authority
and coordinate-availability test.

The missing exact coordinates do not otherwise prevent a coherent zero-major
release line. Exact requests and lockfiles for an unpublished former version
remain broken rather than being redirected. `owlapi@0.1.0` does not satisfy the
former 1.x or 2.x ranges and therefore isolates the initial-development line
from ordinary dormant ranges associated with the unrelated package. New
consumers may use `^0.1.0`; npm's caret semantics admit compatible 0.1.x patches
but do not cross into `0.2.0`.

After `0.1.0`, backwards-compatible corrections increment within the unused
0.1.x patch coordinates, beginning with `0.1.1`. The already-planned
imports-closure, mutation, merger and storage programme is a substantial public
feature line and therefore expects `0.2.0`, not a patch. During initial
development, each subsequent `0.minor.0` is treated as a deliberate compatibility
boundary: it may add material capability or carry an intentionally incompatible
correction, while patches restore the documented contract for their minor line.
No later zero-major coordinate is reserved until an approved release programme
requires it. Every proposed coordinate is still checked against the registry
before release because the known historical list may be incomplete; an
unexpected conflict follows §2.10.2 rather than causing an improvised version
jump.

The first post-zero release is not a deliverable of this plan. When the public
runtime boundary has been exercised through real consumers and no planned work
is expected to require an incompatible correction, a separately approved
stability-promotion programme must rerun the historical exact/range audit and
choose an available coordinate. `1.0.1` may be selected if accepting possible
resolution by dormant former 1.x ranges remains justified; `3.0.0` remains the
more isolated alternative. The burned `1.0.0`, `1.1.0`, `1.2.0`, `1.2.1`,
`1.3.0`, `2.0.0`, and `2.0.1` coordinates can never be recovered, and neither
`1.0.1` nor `3.0.0` is reserved or promised here.

The intended first release is the genuine, functional initial-development prerelease
`0.1.0-alpha.0`, not the commonly placeholder-like `0.0.0-alpha.0`, a reused
historical coordinate or a production release. SemVer's own initial-development
guidance begins at `0.1.0`. Publishing under `next` requires consumers to opt in
and leaves `latest` unset; ordinary non-prerelease ranges exclude prereleases
unless the consumer explicitly includes them. After complete Phase 20
qualification, the production-recommended `0.1.0` establishes `latest` while
remaining explicitly an initial-development API under SemVer. The package README
and npm metadata **MUST**
state prominently that the new implementation is unrelated to the formerly
published Overwatch package and has no code, API or provenance relationship
with it; the new package's licence applies only to package-owned implementation
and documentation. Dependencies and deliberately shipped third-party material
remain under their own recorded terms.

Before production `0.1.0`, the project **MUST** retain the package-name and
immutable-coordinate evidence above and record any newly discovered historical
version. A bounded historical **range** audit is not a `0.1.0` publication gate
because ordinary former 1.x and 2.x ranges cannot select a 0.x release. That
audit becomes mandatory in the separately approved post-zero promotion
programme, when its evidence can inform the actual choice between an available
1.x coordinate and a more isolated later major. Very broad ranges such as `*`
remain a residual package-identity risk under any version and are documented
rather than represented as eliminable.

#### 2.10.2 Claim the name through a real release, not a placeholder

Absence from installation does not prove publishing authority. The project
will test authority through npm's normal publication route before requesting
npm Support. `npm publish --dry-run` is a required artefact preview but cannot
prove that a registry write will be authorized because it deliberately makes
no registry change.

The first write attempt **MUST** use a complete, useful, tested and accurately
documented alpha tarball that the project intends to leave public if the command
succeeds. Publishing a content-free reservation or “coming soon” placeholder is
forbidden: it would create a permanent public coordinate, provide no genuine
function and conflict with npm's active-use/name-squatting policy. A successful
write is the desired first release, not a disposable probe; it **MUST NOT** be
unpublished merely because the attempt was described as a name-availability
test.

The initial claim cannot use npm staged publishing. `npm stage publish` requires
the package to exist already and the caller to have write permission, so it
cannot establish control over this fully unpublished identity. Staged and
trusted publication **SHOULD** be configured for later releases after the first
direct publication establishes the package under project control.

The initial publishing account/organization **MUST** be deliberately selected
as the intended long-term custodian before the write. Public metadata **MUST**
identify compatibility with Java OWLAPI accurately without implying sponsorship
or official status that has not been granted. Account authentication, 2FA,
registry selection and package ownership are release inputs, never credentials
committed to the repository.

If the write fails, Phase 19 **MUST** preserve the exact command, npm/Node
versions, registry, timestamp, error code and sanitized output. Authentication,
2FA and local packaging failures are corrected locally. A namespace/permission
failure after successful authentication is escalated to npm Support with the
failed normal-publication evidence and the no-live-version evidence above. A
version conflict is investigated as additional immutable history rather than
worked around by repeatedly burning candidate versions.

#### 2.10.3 Canonical repository and first-party consumer boundary

The public organization repository
`https://github.com/Hadden-Industries/owlapi` is the **sole canonical source and
release repository** for the package. Its exact owner/repository casing is
normative because npm trusted-publisher and provenance verification compare the
package's repository metadata with the configured GitHub repository. The
repository root is the npm package root and owns:

```text
package production source and package-owned tests
package.json and package-lock.json
README, LICENSE, notices, CHANGELOG and contribution/security policies
package compatibility, provenance and conformance evidence
package CI, release workflows, Git tags and GitHub releases
```

The source currently under WebVOWL's `src/owlapi-js/` is the Phase 19 migration
input, not the permanent repository architecture. Phase 19 performs a
history-preserving, hash-verified extraction and records an auditable mapping
from the accepted WebVOWL source checkpoint to the rewritten canonical history.
After the handoff marker, package changes occur only in
`Hadden-Industries/owlapi`. A finite frozen overlap needed to validate the
handoff is permitted, but it is not a mirror: the WebVOWL copy receives no new
package commits and is removed as part of the application cutover.

The following arrangements are forbidden because they create two authorities
or give the first-party consumer a privileged development path:

```text
a release-only mirror of source maintained in WebVOWL
a hand-copied or generated second production tree
a Git submodule or Git subtree in WebVOWL
a committed file:, link:, Git URL or sibling-directory dependency
an npm workspace link to the extracted source
a Vite/Jest resolver alias to an owlapi checkout
```

WebVOWL itself **MUST** consume `owlapi` through a declared exact registry
dependency and bare package specifiers—never through relative source-tree
paths—so every committed application test and build exercises the same public
entry-point and installed-artefact boundary that external consumers receive.
The only permitted imports of the core are:

```text
owlapi
owlapi/apibinding
owlapi/model
owlapi/io
owlapi/formats
```

Consequently, WebVOWL production modules, WebVOWL-owned tests and examples
**MUST NOT** import `../../owlapi-js/...`, `src/owlapi-js/...`, an unexported
`owlapi/...` deep path, or an alias that resolves a public specifier directly to
a source file. Package-internal modules and package-owned tests in the canonical
repository may use relative imports within that repository; that is
implementation structure, not a consumer bypass.

The private WebVOWL root manifest **MUST** declare `owlapi` in `dependencies`,
not only in `devDependencies`, and pin the exact accepted registry version:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "owlapi": "0.1.0-alpha.0"
  }
}
```

Phase 19 must still obtain the exact WebVOWL configuration approval required
before applying this manifest and lockfile change. The committed lockfile
**MUST** resolve the version from `https://registry.npmjs.org/` with registry
integrity; it must not record a local tarball, checkout or filesystem link.
Vite, Jest and other tooling **MUST NOT** receive a compensating `owlapi` source
alias.

Before a prerelease exists in the registry, the exact retained `npm pack`
tarball is tested in an isolated, disposable WebVOWL checkout using the proposed
bare-import/application patch and a no-save/no-lockfile candidate install. That
procedure may alter only the disposable checkout. After publication, the same
reviewed WebVOWL changes are applied to the maintained branch, the exact
registry version is installed normally and the resulting registry lockfile is
committed. Local tarball testing proves the candidate before a registry write;
ordinary WebVOWL CI thereafter proves the actual external-consumer path. Both
gates are mandatory.

#### 2.10.4 Public API Surface Registry and two-zone source layout

The public package boundary is defined by an explicit npm `exports` map and a
machine-readable **Public API Surface Registry**, not by the mere presence of a
directory or Java class. Except for the bare aggregate described below, every
public npm subpath **MUST** map one-to-one to an existing package beneath
`org.semanticweb.owlapi` in the pinned Java OWLAPI reference version. The npm
subpath is the Java package suffix with dots replaced by slashes:

```text
org.semanticweb.owlapi.model.parameters
                    ↓
owlapi/model/parameters
```

The existence of a Java package is **necessary but not sufficient** for a
public npm subpath. Publication additionally requires an approved registry
entry, a non-empty explicit named-export inventory, a demonstrated direct
consumer use, compatibility evidence, package-boundary tests and acceptance of
the resulting SemVer commitment. Java source visibility, Javadoc inclusion,
Maven-module placement, package depth and an implementation dependency do not
create an npm API automatically.

The bare package `owlapi` is the sole structural exception. It is a curated
JavaScript convenience aggregate and has no claimed one-to-one Java package.
Every root binding nevertheless **MUST** be an explicit re-export of an approved
binding from a registered Java-backed subpath. The root may not be used to
smuggle a JavaScript-only subsystem into the public contract.

The `0.1.0` registry exposes exactly:

| Public specifier | Responsibility | Java OWLAPI relationship |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `owlapi` | Curated convenience facade for the supported ordinary workflow | Explicit JavaScript aggregate exception |
| `owlapi/apibinding` | Manager bootstrap | `org.semanticweb.owlapi.apibinding` |
| `owlapi/model` | Structural objects, ontology, ontology manager, data factory, model-level loader configuration and document-format base | `org.semanticweb.owlapi.model` |
| `owlapi/io` | Document sources and I/O/parser diagnostics | `org.semanticweb.owlapi.io` |
| `owlapi/formats` | Supported ontology-document format identities | `org.semanticweb.owlapi.formats` |

Nested Java packages may later be added at their complete natural depth, for
example `org.semanticweb.owlapi.model.parameters` as
`owlapi/model/parameters`. No empty or speculative namespace is created in
advance. A deep subpath may be exported without making each textual prefix a
separate importable module; the `exports` map lists exact consumer specifiers.

There is no default export, wildcard subpath, public `package.json`, or invented
public `manager`, `parser`, `storer`, `rdfjs`, `browser`, `node`, `helpers`,
`compat`, `structural` or `internal` subpath. Environment-specific
behavior uses the same Java-backed API through the source-level,
capability-detecting internal adapters required by §17.26.1.1. A package-level
environment target requires the separately approved failure evidence and test
matrix defined there. A genuinely independent JavaScript integration belongs
inside `internal/` or in a separately governed companion package, not in a new
core-package namespace that lacks a Java package counterpart.

##### 2.10.4.1 Registry ownership and gap reporting

The existing capability matrix remains authoritative for behavioural scope;
the new registry is its package/type/method projection, not a competing feature
status system. During the WebVOWL staging period the normative requirements live
in this plan. Phase 19 creates the maintained machine-readable registry at:

```text
Hadden-Industries/owlapi/docs/compatibility/java-api-surface.json
```

and a generated or mechanically checked human view at:

```text
Hadden-Industries/owlapi/docs/compatibility/java-api-surface.md
```

The existing staging capability file moves from
`docs/owlapi-js/compatibility/capabilities.json` to
`Hadden-Industries/owlapi/docs/compatibility/capabilities.json`; WebVOWL does
not retain a second normative copy after handoff.

Support, progress, exposure, relationship, compatibility and public stability
commitment are independent dimensions. The registry **MUST NOT** call an
internal but complete capability unsupported, a public nominal binding
implemented, or a private row deprecated merely because it has no public
stability commitment. It records:

```text
capability status  REQUIRED_V1 | DEFERRED | UNSUPPORTED_BY_DESIGN | DELEGATED
progress           NOT_STARTED | IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETE
exposure           PUBLIC | INTERNAL_ONLY | NOT_EXPOSED
relationship       JAVA_ANALOGUE | JS_ADAPTATION | JS_EXTENSION | INTERNAL
compatibility      COMPATIBLE | ADAPTED | CONTROLLED_DEVIATION | NOT_APPLICABLE
stability           PRERELEASE | INITIAL_DEVELOPMENT | DEPRECATED_INITIAL_DEVELOPMENT | null
```

`stability` is non-null only for a `PUBLIC` binding. Alpha public bindings use
`PRERELEASE`; bindings in the accepted production cutover version transition to
`INITIAL_DEVELOPMENT`, or to
`DEPRECATED_INITIAL_DEVELOPMENT` only when the retained binding and replacement/migration
contract satisfy §2.27. `INTERNAL_ONLY` and `NOT_EXPOSED` rows use `null` because
their exposure—not a fictional public stability promise—governs them.

Every namespace row records the exact Java package, exact npm subpath or `null`,
exposure, first public release where applicable, rationale and owned symbol IDs.
Every Java type row records at least its fully qualified Java name and kind,
linked capability IDs, progress, exposure, stability, JS export or `null`, canonical public
specifier or `null`, canonical source module or `null`, relationship,
compatibility classification, supported/omitted public members, verification
hooks and contribution/issue guidance. A public `JS_EXTENSION` row has no direct
Java type but **MUST** identify the closest Java authority, justify why the
language/runtime adaptation is necessary, and live in an already registered
Java-backed namespace; it cannot authorize a new npm subpath.

The pinned Java API inventory supplies every public
`org.semanticweb.owlapi` package and public type. Before a production release, each
must have a registry disposition and the unclassified count must be zero. The
registry inventories public members in detail for every mapped public type;
unmapped types may remain type-level gaps until their namespace/capability is
promoted. This produces both a compact package summary and drill-down detail so
developers can see what is public, internally implemented, deferred or excluded
and can open a correctly scoped issue or pull request.

Executable fitness checks **MUST** prove that:

1. every `exports` subpath except `.` has one exact registry row and exact Java
   package mapping;
2. every public registry row has a real facade, non-empty explicit export list,
   packed-package import test and first-release value;
3. every public binding is enumerated and its root/subpath duplicates have
   identical JavaScript identity;
4. every registry `sourceModule` and verification reference exists;
5. the registry and capability matrix agree on capability IDs, progress and
   scope, and every public/private row obeys the stability/exposure invariant;
6. the generated Markdown summary is current; and
7. wildcard, unregistered and internal imports fail from an installed tarball.

##### 2.10.4.2 Public compatibility tree and private implementation tree

The standalone source has two intentionally different zones:

1. **Public Java-compatibility tree.** A registered public namespace follows the
   exact Java package suffix. Every public binding has exactly one canonical
   definition in that namespace and an `index.js` file with explicit named
   exports. Closely related immutable types may share one cohesive source module
   when that is clearer; the registry still maps each binding to that module.
2. **Private JavaScript implementation tree.** `internal/` contains only engines,
   algorithms, adapters, indexes, resource/security machinery and platform
   integration that consumers do not import directly. It is organized by
   cohesive implementation responsibility and **MUST NOT** mechanically mirror
   the Java/public package tree.

There is no duplicate `internal/<public-namespace>` implementation layer merely
to forward the same binding twice. A public Java-compatible class may delegate
to a deeper private engine, but the public class itself has one definition and
one binding identity. Internal code uses direct module imports where needed and
does not depend on root/public barrels in ways that introduce cycles.

The current WebVOWL staging directories therefore do not survive automatically:

| Staging ownership | Canonical standalone ownership |
| --- | --- |
| `manager/owlManager.js` | public `apibinding/` namespace |
| `manager/owlOntologyManager.js` and public loader/model types | public `model/` namespace |
| private parser registry and document-loading orchestration | `internal/parsing/` and `internal/loading/` by actual responsibility |
| `parser/**` syntax engines and third-party adapters | `internal/parsing/**` |
| `rdf/rdfToOwlTranslator.js` and `rdf/owlToRdfTranslator.js` | `internal/mapping/` |
| RDF/JS factories, datasets and graph policy | `internal/rdfjs/` |
| future private concrete serialization machinery | `internal/storage/<format>/` |
| structural equality, indexes and platform/XML helpers | focused `internal/structural/`, `internal/indexing/` or `internal/platform/` ownership |

Names such as `manager`, `parser` and `rdf` are not retained as generic private
buckets merely because they exist in the staging tree. A JavaScript-specific
private directory is permitted only when it names one cohesive implementation
responsibility required by registered capabilities, does not duplicate a public
type's owner and is absent from `exports`.

For example, if a future approved release directly exposes Java's
`org.semanticweb.owlapi.rdf.rdfxml.renderer.RDFXMLStorer`, its compatibility
type belongs at `rdf/rdfxml/renderer/` and the exact public specifier is
`owlapi/rdf/rdfxml/renderer`. The private RDF/XML serializer may remain under
`internal/storage/rdfxml/`; no mirrored
`internal/rdf/rdfxml/renderer/` directory or private-engine move is required.
That hypothetical publication still requires its own registry decision and does
not make `owlapi/rdf` or `owlapi/rdf/rdfxml` importable.

For `0.1.0`, no such RDF package is public. RDF-based document loading remains
fully supported through `OWLManager`, `OWLOntologyManager`, document sources,
loader configuration and format identities. RDF syntax adapters produce RDF/JS
quads, the shared `RdfToOwlTranslator` reconstructs structural OWL, and the
tested `OwlToRdfTranslator` supports round-trip evidence and future storers.
Those modules are `INTERNAL_ONLY`; the staging `src/owlapi-js/rdf/index.js`
export does not survive as `owlapi/rdf`.

For each `JAVA_ANALOGUE` or `JS_ADAPTATION`, record the exact public specifier,
Java class/interface/member and package, supported operations, intentional
omissions and material JavaScript adaptations. Paired Java/JavaScript examples
must cover manager creation, document loading, data-factory access, IRI creation
and ontology querying. The compatibility claim is a JavaScript-native,
behaviourally compatible **subset** for declared capabilities; it is not Java
source compatibility, binary compatibility or complete surface parity.

The familiar primary workflow remains:

```javascript
import { OWLManager } from "owlapi/apibinding";
import { StringDocumentSource } from "owlapi/io";

const manager = OWLManager.createOWLOntologyManager();
const ontology = await manager.loadOntologyFromOntologyDocument(
  new StringDocumentSource(text),
);
const dataFactory = manager.getOWLDataFactory();
```

JavaScript-only manager operations already required by WebVOWL, including the
document/diagnostic-rich load result, are labelled `JS_EXTENSION`; they do not
replace or contradict the Java-recognizable
`loadOntologyFromOntologyDocument` operation.

### 2.11 Decision: alpha and production release package the proven Phase 18 capability surface

The first public alpha is a package/release milestone for the capability surface
already accepted at the Phase 18 source checkpoint
`b5902e98da94a1ed99da174acea906aa42f9a46b`. Phase 19 may make only the
packaging-boundary changes required to expose and consume that implementation;
it **MUST NOT** add ontology semantics, mutation APIs, utilities or storers in
order to make the first tarball appear more complete.

The useful `0.1.0-alpha.0` claim includes the existing structural OWL model,
manager/document loading surface, imports loading, internal RDF/JS ingestion
boundary, shared RDF→OWL reconstruction, tested internal OWL→RDF mapping, and
the twelve accepted input formats:

```text
Functional Syntax    Manchester Syntax    OWL/XML
RDF/XML              Turtle               DL Syntax
KRSS1                KRSS2                N-Triples
N-Quads              TriG                 JSON-LD
```

The alpha does **not** claim the standalone import-closure materialization
workflow described in
`docs/owlapi-js/compatibility/standalone-import-closure-prerequisites.md`.
Specifically, the following coherent capability slice is absent from
`0.1.0-alpha.0` and **MUST** be stated as unavailable in its README, capability
documentation and release notes:

```text
public imports-closure query/copy APIs and closure-set provider
ontology merger
manager-backed ontology mutation/change application
ontology-ID and ontology-annotation changes
saveOntology and StringDocumentTarget
Functional Syntax storer
RDF/XML storer
strict complete RDF reconstruction required for lossless storage
```

This limitation does not contradict the existing ability to load ontology
imports: import loading and exposing a complete public query/mutation/merge/store
workflow are different contracts. Neither npm metadata nor examples may claim
that `universal-ontology` can materialize a standalone imports closure with
`alpha.0`.

The absent slice is owned by
`docs/owlapi-js/ontology-lifecycle-capability-implementation-plan.md`. It is not a
prerequisite for a production-worthy WebVOWL ingestion package and **MUST NOT**
be pulled into the current plan merely to broaden the first production version.

Phase 20 productionizes the same declared capability families as the alpha. It
may correct demonstrated defects, security problems, portability failures,
diagnostics, documentation, or packaging, but it may not add a parser,
ontology-operation family, storer, public workflow, or speculative API. Production
`0.1.0` is gated by public-package and WebVOWL production evidence—not by the
follow-on imports-closure, mutation, merger, or storage feature programme.

### 2.12 Decision: publish `owlapi` under `AGPL-3.0-only`

The initial `owlapi` prerelease and subsequent zero-major package lines are
licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 only, using the
exact SPDX identifier
`AGPL-3.0-only`. This is a deliberate package-governance choice, not a licence
inherited accidentally from the containing WebVOWL repository. The
specifications-first reimplementation and provenance controls in §22 made that
choice available on defensible terms; they did not exist in order to force the
new core toward a permissive licence.

The decisive policy objective is strong source reciprocity that includes the
AGPL network-interaction provision. A permissive licence would maximize the
number of proprietary integrations, while MPL-2.0 would require reciprocity at
the covered-file level. Neither expresses the selected social contract as
directly as AGPL-3.0-only. WebVOWL remains AGPL-3.0-only as well, but the
application and package are still separate copyright/licensing scopes: package
metadata and a package-local licence establish the terms of `owlapi`; the root
licence continues to establish the terms of WebVOWL and other root-owned work.

The `only` suffix is intentional. A recipient of an AGPL-3.0-only release is
not granted an automatic option to apply a future AGPL version. Copyright
holders with sufficient authority may later publish their own contributions
under additional or more permissive terms, but doing so would not revoke the
AGPL-3.0-only rights already granted for earlier releases. The project **MUST
NOT** describe later permissive relicensing as unconditionally available:
incorporating an outside contribution can require that contributor's consent
unless the contribution terms separately grant the project adequate
relicensing authority. Section 2.14 therefore fixes the initial
inbound=outbound policy and a mandatory decision gate before the first external
copyrightable contribution is merged. A contributor agreement for hypothetical
future contributors is not a first-publication prerequisite while the audited
package contains no accepted external copyrightable contribution; the first
affected merge, not the first alpha, is the blocking decision point.

Before the first publication, the licence/provenance gate **MUST**:

1. identify every copyright holder or authorized licensor for the package-owned
   production and shipped documentation files and record the basis of their
   licensing authority;
2. verify the exact retained tarball rather than inferring its licensing surface
   from the source directory;
3. distinguish package-owned AGPL-3.0-only material from dependencies and any
   deliberately shipped third-party material that remains under its own terms;
4. include the complete package-local AGPLv3 licence text, set package metadata
   to `AGPL-3.0-only`, and preserve every required third-party notice; and
5. explain the WebVOWL/`owlapi` licensing boundary in both repository and
   package-facing documentation without implying that package dependencies have
   been relicensed under the AGPL.

This is engineering governance rather than legal advice. Publication remains
blocked if ownership authority or any tarball item's applicable terms cannot be
established with adequate confidence.

### 2.13 Decision: retain personal copyright and separate title from stewardship

As of this decision, **Maksym Shostak personally owns the copyright in his
existing project-owned `owlapi` work**. Neither publication of
`0.1.0-alpha.0` nor publication of production `0.1.0` is conditional on assigning
that copyright to HADDEN INDUSTRIES LTD. Unless and until a written assignment
actually takes effect, package-facing records **MUST** identify Maksym Shostak
as the copyright owner of his contributions and **MUST NOT** describe HADDEN
INDUSTRIES LTD as their copyright owner or licensor.

HADDEN INDUSTRIES LTD is instead the institutional **project steward** for the
canonical repository and package. The complete public identification is
**HADDEN INDUSTRIES LTD, registered in England and Wales under company number
07862561**, linked to
`https://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/07862561`. Repository ownership,
npm access, project stewardship and a copyright notice are distinct facts; none
of the first three transfers copyright by implication.

This decision keeps three continuity controls separate:

1. **Copyright title and licensing authority.** Maksym Shostak owns and licenses
   his existing contributions under `AGPL-3.0-only`; each later contributor
   retains copyright unless a separately approved written agreement says
   otherwise.
2. **Durable recipient rights and succession.** A compliant AGPLv3 grant lasts
   for the copyright term and is irrevocable under its terms. Copyright can pass
   by testamentary disposition, inheritance or other operation of law, so the
   original author's death does not withdraw the existing AGPL grant or put
   published source into a use/maintenance limbo.
3. **Operational custody.** Continued control of the exact GitHub repository,
   npm package and trusted-publishing path depends on the actual credentialed
   account holder, recovery settings and a usable release runbook—not on who
   owns copyright. For this plan that human account holder is solely Maksym
   Shostak; the resulting availability risk is accepted rather than described as
   continuity.

Personal estate planning, including a will that may transfer the relevant
copyright to HADDEN INDUSTRIES LTD or another chosen successor, is external to
the software release process and **MUST NOT** be made a Phase 19 or Phase 20
gate. No will, probate record, signed assignment, address, signature or other
private estate material belongs in Git, an npm tarball or public release
evidence.

A lifetime assignment remains an optional future legal and commercial decision.
If one is later chosen, it must be written and signed as required by applicable
law, professionally reviewed where appropriate, and scoped against an objective
source checkpoint/path inventory with third-party material excluded. Public
ownership notices may change only after the instrument has taken effect; the
change must preserve original authorship and the separate ownership of any
outside contributor. A non-sensitive attestation may then record the parties,
effective date, covered checkpoint/path scope and excluded-material classes,
but is evidence of—not a substitute for—the private instrument.

The source/package metadata fixed by this decision is:

```json
{
  "author": {
    "name": "Maksym Shostak",
    "url": "https://github.com/MaksymShostak"
  },
  "license": "AGPL-3.0-only"
}
```

The SPDX expression remains the machine-readable `license` value; a URL does
not replace it. Until an assignment actually takes effect, the package README
uses this role-separated notice:

```markdown

The plain-text `NOTICE` uses literal URLs rather than relying on Markdown
rendering:

Before publication, Phase 19 **MUST** verify that the retained tarball's rights
inventory, `package.json`, README, `NOTICE`, `LICENSE`, provenance and
third-party notices agree with those facts. Separately, it **MUST** establish the
single named npm/GitHub custody and bounded machine-authority controls specified
in §17.26.4. Maksym Shostak is the only natural-person custodian required by this
plan; the npm identities `maksymshostak` and `hadden-industries` remain
operational registry identities rather than evidence of copyright ownership or
multi-person continuity.

### 2.14 Decision: begin with inbound=outbound and gate the first external merge

The initial outside-contribution model for `owlapi` is **inbound=outbound under
`AGPL-3.0-only`**. An outside contributor retains copyright in an accepted
contribution and grants the contribution under the same `AGPL-3.0-only` terms
under which the package is distributed. No copyright assignment or separate
contributor licence agreement (CLA) is required for `0.1.0-alpha.0`, provided
the Phase 19 rights inventory confirms that all existing package-owned material
is owned by its identified holder or is otherwise covered by an adequate
recorded licence.

The project **MUST** state this policy directly in repository contribution
guidance rather than relying only on GitHub's platform-wide contribution terms.
The guidance must say that contributors retain copyright, that accepted
contributions are licensed as `AGPL-3.0-only`, that contributors represent they
have authority to make that grant, and that no broader relicensing authority or
copyright transfer is inferred from submitting a pull request. Contributions
made through a different channel are subject to the same explicit policy.

#### 2.14.1 First-external-contribution trigger

For this gate, an **external copyrightable contribution** is substantive
authored material outside the then-current first-party copyright inventory that
is proposed for incorporation into the package-owned implementation or shipped
package material. Treat substantive production source, public declarations or
types, package documentation/assets, generated distributable content and any
test/fixture/helper expression copied or incorporated into production as in
scope. An issue report, abstract idea, behavioural description or unmerged
proposal does not by itself cross the gate; an open pull request may be discussed
and reviewed, but **MUST NOT** be merged while the gate is unresolved. When it
is genuinely unclear whether a proposed change is copyrightable or who owns it,
the project **MUST** treat the change as in scope until the uncertainty is
resolved rather than relying casually on a “trivial contribution” exception.

Immediately before accepting the first such contribution, the project **MUST**
pause and record one of these two separately approved outcomes:

1. **Confirm pure inbound=outbound.** Accept the contribution only under
   `AGPL-3.0-only`, record the contributor's/actual copyright holder's authority,
   and knowingly accept that a later permissive licence for affected material
   will require additional permission from every relevant holder or exclusion
   and independent replacement of that material.
2. **Adopt a contributor-retained-copyright CLA before merge.** Obtain a
   professionally reviewed agreement that leaves ownership with the
   contributor while granting the separately approved project counterparty the
   expressly bounded copyright and patent authority selected at that future
   checkpoint—for example, continued AGPL distribution plus publication under
   defined OSI-approved licences. The counterparty, exact agreement, acceptance
   mechanism, employer authority and record-custody process require their own
   approval; they are not silently predetermined by this plan.

No later CLA, project-policy edit or package-metadata change may be applied
retroactively to a contribution without the actual rights holder's agreement.
A GitHub username or commit author is not necessarily the copyright holder; an
employer or another entity may need to grant the additional rights.

#### 2.14.2 Later licence changes under the initial model

While every included copyright holder has sufficient authority, those holders
may later approve an additional or more permissive licence for a precisely
audited future release. The release process must fix the covered source
checkpoint and tarball scope, verify ownership and third-party terms, document
every required holder decision, update every licence/notice/metadata surface
consistently and publish a clearly versioned new artefact. Earlier AGPL grants
remain available and irrevocable according to their terms; neither changing
repository metadata nor unpublishing an npm artefact can retract rights already
granted.

After a pure inbound=outbound external contribution has been incorporated, a
permissive licence for the whole affected module requires a sufficient written
grant from every relevant copyright holder. If a holder refuses or cannot be
located, the project must keep the affected work under AGPL-compatible terms,
exclude it, or independently replace all remaining protectable expression and
record that provenance. Git history, line deletion, squashing and `git blame`
alone are not proof that an incorporated contribution has ceased to be present.
Dependencies and separately licensed material remain governed by their own
terms in every case.

#### 2.14.3 Phase 19 implementation and evidence

Phase 19 **MUST** obtain the exact repository-configuration approval required
for a new root `CONTRIBUTING.md` in `Hadden-Industries/owlapi`, then publish the
§2.14 policy there and link it from the package README. The package-repository
governance test must assert the presence and
agreement of the package licence, copyright-retention statement,
inbound=outbound rule and first-external-merge gate. The release evidence must
also attest that every copyrightable item in the reviewed `0.1.0-alpha.0`
source/tarball has an identified holder and adequate distribution authority,
with no unresolved external contribution.

This deliberately avoids building speculative CLA administration before an
outside contributor exists while preventing the first merge from silently
fragmenting future licensing authority. The checkpoint concerns acceptance of
authored material; issue discussion and review can continue while the decision
is made.

### 2.15 Decision: the public README explains why `owlapi` exists

The `Hadden-Industries/owlapi` README **MUST** contain a concise, prominent
“Why `owlapi` exists” section. It records the technical need that justified an
independently governed implementation and why the available alternatives did
not satisfy that complete need. The project-origin discussion at
`https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-6a7b7000aa2481919350a95588536362/c/6a738373-7b6c-83eb-b36b-d675a4a69b43`
is one source of the rationale to synthesize with the implementation record.

The README rationale **MUST** explain:

1. Java OWLAPI was and remains the compatibility reference, but retaining a JVM
   does not provide the browser-native/package boundary required by WebVOWL and
   other JavaScript consumers;
2. the evaluated alternatives solved different subsets of the problem—such as
   wrapping Java OWLAPI, exposing a Rust/Wasm model or reasoner, or performing
   RDF rule reasoning—without constituting a substitutable JavaScript structural
   API for the required use cases;
3. the difficult part is not merely parsing RDF/XML or another concrete syntax,
   but preserving OWL structural distinctions across native syntaxes and the
   RDF-to-OWL mapping while exposing stable ontology objects;
4. WebVOWL supplied the first demanding production consumer and differential
   oracle, but the resulting package deliberately contains no VOWL concepts;
5. the implementation is specifications-first and independently authored;
   Java OWLAPI supplies behavioural compatibility evidence rather than a
   source-transliteration template; and
6. `0.1.0-alpha.0` is useful but bounded: it documents the exact accepted
   capability surface and must not claim complete Java OWLAPI parity.

The comparison should name relevant adjacent approaches such as `owljs`,
OntoLogos, `owlish` and HyLAR where they help explain the design choice, without
turning the README into a market survey or implying that those projects were
trying to solve precisely the same problem.

### 2.16 Decision: publish one retained artefact through npm and an immutable GitHub release

Each public version has one release tarball. The bytes reviewed as the release
candidate, published to npm, attached to the GitHub release and used for final
consumer verification **MUST** be identical. A release workflow must never run
`npm pack` again merely because it has crossed an approval, publication or
verification boundary.

The release set is:

| Item | Normative role |
| --- | --- |
| signed annotated `v<version>` Git tag | binds the version to its reviewed canonical source commit |
| `owlapi-<version>.tgz` | sole installable release artefact |
| `owlapi-<version>.cdx.json` | §2.47 validated reproducible CycloneDX 1.6 JSON SBOM whose root component is the exact `owlapi@<version>` library and whose unflattened/full-PURL dependency graph contains the production install closure only |
| `SHA256SUMS` | exact §2.52 sorted lowercase SHA-256 entries for the retained tarball and SBOM, using stable asset basenames and no other entries |
| `owlapi-<version>.release-evidence.json` | versioned machine-readable publication and verification record generated after fresh-registry checks, including the normalized §2.51 root-package attestation identity, and before release immutability |
| npm provenance/publish attestations | bind the public registry package to the public GitHub source and publishing workflow |
| immutable GitHub release and automatic release attestation | bind the tag, source commit and attached release assets, then pass the exact §2.52 fresh-download release/per-asset verification |
| repository `docs/provenance/releases/<version>/release.json` and notes | append-only post-release index identifying the immutable release/attestation plus source, workflow, registry, test and controlled-deviation evidence without changing package bytes |

The signed annotated tag is release-specific and **MUST NOT** be moved. Under
§2.60, `release.yml` first builds and fully qualifies the retained candidate at
the accepted protected-`main` commit while no canonical `v<version>` tag exists.
For every post-bootstrap release, the same run also stages, downloads and proves
the byte identity of that retained tarball before the tag is created. A human
then signs and pushes the canonical tag at the already-fixed commit, and the
same run verifies its target, signature, authorized signer and GitHub result
before the staged package may be promoted. The initial bootstrap cannot stage;
its tag is therefore created after all non-mutating gates and immediately before
the separately authorized direct publication boundary.

Once the verified tag exists, the GitHub release is created as a draft so the
retained tarball, SBOM and `SHA256SUMS` can be attached and reviewed before the
package becomes public. The npm public write occurs only after the applicable
required gates and human authorization: the protected `npm-release` environment gates the
bootstrap write or steady-state stage creation, and steady-state promotion also
requires the exact staged-candidate review plus interactive 2FA. The draft
remains unpublished while a fresh-cache consumer verifies the registry tarball,
integrity, provenance, exports and distribution tag. The §2.40 evidence manifest
is then attached and verified before the draft is published with repository
release immutability enabled. After publication, the tag, release notes and
assets are historical evidence and are not edited or replaced; a correction
requires a new package version.

The initial `0.1.0-alpha.0` claim **MUST** run through a manual dispatch of the
canonical `.github/workflows/release.yml` at the exact accepted protected-`main`
commit, with `ubuntu-24.04` x64 as the sole §2.57 artefact-producing host. The
workflow derives the version, expected canonical tag and channel from reviewed
repository state rather than a free-form dispatch identity.
Because an npm trusted
publisher cannot be configured for a package that does not yet exist, that one
bootstrap write uses a one-day npm granular access token created in npm's web
interface with write access, bypass-2FA enabled for the non-interactive workflow
and the narrowest package selection the registry actually permits. If the
not-yet-created `owlapi` coordinate cannot be selected, the approval and evidence
**MUST** call the resulting temporary all-packages write authority by its real
scope rather than falsely describing it as package-scoped. The token is held
only in a protected GitHub deployment environment, never passed to untrusted
pull-request code, logs, release assets or repository files, and is revoked and
removed immediately after its single authorized attempt; expiration is only a
backstop. The bootstrap publication job alone uses `contents: read`,
`id-token: write`, npm's explicit `--provenance` mode and the exact retained
tarball. After success, a reviewed configuration change removes the dead token
branch/reference from the same stable workflow path before trusted publishing is
enabled.

Subsequent releases use the exact case-sensitive
`Hadden-Industries/owlapi`/`.github/workflows/release.yml`/`npm-release`
repository/workflow/environment identity configured as the npm OIDC trusted
publisher. The preferred steady
state grants that publisher stage-only authority, runs `npm stage publish` for
the retained tarball before the canonical tag exists, requires npm's
proof-of-presence review/approval only after the later tag passes §2.60, and
keeps traditional token publication disabled. The no-authority §2.61
`release-manual` gates acknowledge the verified tag and later completed
interactive promotion without entering the trusted-publisher identity or
occupying a runner. Before signing that tag, an
interactively authenticated maintainer downloads the staged tarball, proves
that its SHA-256 is byte-for-byte identical to the retained tarball and
revalidates the staged candidate under §2.53. npm's automatic provenance under trusted publishing is
authoritative; the workflow omits `--provenance` and **MUST NOT** add a redundant
`actions/attest` step merely to duplicate npm provenance or the automatic
immutable-release attestation. A future additional attestation requires a
documented consumer or threat-model need and separate workflow approval.

#### 2.16.1 Required and extended browser evidence

The installed-package suite uses exact `@playwright/test@1.62.1` and its managed
Chromium, Firefox and WebKit revisions in three separate one-worker, cache-free
`ubuntu-24.04` x64 jobs as a required package check. Every
engine must pass representative public-manager ingestion through the retained
tarball in the ordinary bundler document, native document/import-map and bundled
dedicated-worker consumers fixed by §2.21 before npm publication. A skipped,
cancelled or infrastructure-invalid required engine or required consumption mode
is not a passing result.

Branded browser channels, historical browser versions, hosted browser services
and physical/real-device runs are extended evidence. They are valuable but
non-blocking because their availability is not controlled by the package release
workflow. Every release note **MUST** report each planned extended environment
as exactly one of:

```text
PASS     — the stated test scope executed and passed
FAIL     — the stated test scope executed and produced a product-visible failure
NOT_RUN  — no valid product result exists; record why and the last attempted date
```

`INFRASTRUCTURE_ERROR` may be used transiently inside a test job for retry and
diagnosis, but it is not a valid final release-evidence state. An unresolved
provider/device/infrastructure failure becomes `NOT_RUN` with the concrete
reason; it must not be misreported as a product `PASS` or `FAIL`. An extended
`FAIL` is disclosed as a known result/limitation but does not override the
approved non-blocking classification.

The immutable GitHub release records the matrix as it stood at publication and
links to the version-specific §2.40 evidence hierarchy in the canonical
repository. If an extended environment is exercised later, add a new dated,
append-only observation and update any generated/curated summary in a normal
signed/traceable documentation commit. Do not overwrite an earlier observation.
The package tarball, npm version and immutable release assets are not changed
merely to add later non-blocking evidence.

### 2.17 Decision: private vulnerability reporting and an explicit support window

The canonical repository **MUST** enable GitHub private vulnerability reporting
and publish a root `SECURITY.md`. Its reporting order is:

1. GitHub private vulnerability reporting for `Hadden-Industries/owlapi` is the
   preferred channel because it opens the repository's private advisory
   workflow; and
2. `security@haddenindustries.com` is the durable company-controlled fallback
   when that mechanism is unavailable or unsuitable.

The security address is reserved for vulnerabilities and other genuinely
security-sensitive project correspondence. Suspected vulnerabilities **MUST
NOT** be submitted through public issues, discussions or pull requests, and the
address **MUST NOT** be reused for Code of Conduct reports. The package README
links to the canonical `SECURITY.md` rather than duplicating a policy that can
change independently of a package release.

HADDEN INDUSTRIES LTD controls the role address. For this implementation plan,
access is delegated only to Maksym Shostak through an individually authenticated
account rather than a shared-account password. MFA, least privilege and
auditable membership are required before production publication. External delivery,
reply identity, spam handling and unintended forwarding/recipient behaviour are
tested before the address is represented as operational. A second responder and
account-continuity arrangement are desirable post-plan governance improvements,
not alpha, production-release or plan-completion gates. Secrets and personal report
data do not enter public release evidence.

The public support policy is deliberately narrow:

| Release state | Security-supported version |
| --- | --- |
| before production `0.1.0` | only the single prerelease currently designated by `next` |
| after production `0.1.0` | only the latest production release designated by `latest`; an older zero-major line is unsupported once `latest` advances unless an explicit policy says otherwise |
| older production or prerelease lines | unsupported unless a future, explicit LTS/security-branch policy names them |

Old versions remain available under npm's immutability rules, but availability
does not imply security maintenance. `SECURITY.md` **MUST** name the supported
versions/ranges accurately and may be updated after a release without changing
that package. The package-version table is distinct from the §2.19 runtime
matrix: after a supported Node major reaches upstream end of life, continued
0.1.x runtime compatibility does not imply that `owlapi` can correct a defect in
the unmaintained runtime itself. `SECURITY.md` and the README must state that
limitation rather than silently dropping the declared 0.1.x floor or overstating
security coverage.

The project aims to acknowledge a private vulnerability report within five
working days. This is a target, not an SLA, guaranteed resolution time or
promise that the report is valid. Triage records affected versions, severity,
reproduction, embargo/coordination needs and the reporter's preferred contact.
Confirmed issues use a GitHub security advisory and request/associate a CVE when
the issue warrants one. Public disclosure is coordinated after a fixed version
and mitigation are available unless an overriding safety or legal reason is
recorded.

A security release may be expedited, but it is not exempt from the deterministic
artefact, required-test, production-dependency, provenance, retained-tarball,
fresh-registry and consumer-verification gates. Sensitive details may remain in
the private advisory until coordinated disclosure; the evidence must still show
that every integrity gate ran without leaking embargoed material.

### 2.18 Decision: separate, private Code of Conduct reporting

The canonical repository **MUST** contain a root `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` based on
Contributor Covenant 3.0, retain its required attribution and permanent version
link, define the repository/project interaction scope, and state its actual
enforcement and reporting process. It is repository governance, not package
runtime documentation, and **MUST** be excluded from the npm tarball.

HADDEN INDUSTRIES LTD appoints the project moderator. Possible violations are
reported privately to `conduct@haddenindustries.com`. Reports **MUST NOT** be
filed in public issues or discussions and **MUST NOT** be routed through
`security@haddenindustries.com` or GitHub's vulnerability-reporting mechanism.
For this plan, the conduct address is a company-controlled role mailbox delegated
only to Maksym Shostak through an individually authenticated account; it must not
forward to a broad maintainer or employee list.

Maksym Shostak is the sole moderator required before production publication. If he
is named in a report, directly involved in the reported events or otherwise
materially conflicted, he **MUST NOT** adjudicate or take enforcement action on
that report alone. The policy accurately discloses that the initial governance
model has no independent internal handler; the report remains restricted and
pending for separately governed post-plan appointment or an applicable external
legal/platform process. Neither appointing nor retaining a second moderator is a
release-completion requirement. The policy promises restricted need-to-know
handling rather than absolute confidentiality, which email and a fair
investigation cannot guarantee. Public enforcement statements minimize personal
information and are made only when necessary and proportionate under the
adopted policy.

`CONTRIBUTING.md` remains the authority for contribution mechanics,
inbound=outbound licensing, contributor copyright and the first-external-merge
gate. `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` governs behaviour. `SECURITY.md` governs private
vulnerability disclosure. None of those responsibilities is merged into a
generic support mailbox, and no public author email is added to `package.json`:
the author metadata continues to use Maksym Shostak's named GitHub identity.

### 2.19 Decision: support Node 22 and 24, and build releases on Node 24

The alpha and production package manifests **MUST** declare this exact Node engine
range:

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "^22.0.0 || ^24.0.0"
  }
}
```

The Phase 19 required package matrix fixes Node `22.23.2` and Node `24.19.0`.
Both run the full package suite on §2.57 `ubuntu-24.04` x64 and the focused
installed-tarball suite on its Windows x64 and macOS arm64 representatives. The
release workflow builds, packs, signs, stages/publishes and performs its
release-side authoritative verification only on Ubuntu/Node `24.19.0`; the Node
22 lanes prove the compatibility floor. Workflow configuration uses those literal patches,
not the `22`, `24`, `lts/*`, `node` or `latest` aliases, and release evidence
records the actual Node/npm identities. A later patch replacement follows the
separate exact-tool update rule in §2.54 and does not alter the public engine
range merely because a CI patch changes.

Node 26 is a non-blocking current-release probe until it becomes LTS. After that
transition, adding `|| ^26.0.0` and making Node 26 blocking requires the normal
exact package/CI configuration approval and a passing package, pack/install and
WebVOWL-consumer matrix. A current-release probe does not silently broaden the
published `engines` claim.

Node 22 remains the 0.1.x compatibility floor. Its eventual upstream end of life
does not itself authorize a breaking floor increase inside 0.1.x, but the README
and security policy **MUST** distinguish runtime compatibility from upstream
security maintenance: once Node 22 is no longer maintained by Node.js, the
project cannot promise remediation of vulnerabilities that require upstream
runtime changes. A separately approved support-policy decision is required if a
concrete security or platform constraint makes continued 0.1.x compatibility
untenable; an incompatible floor increase requires the next available
zero-major feature line while the package remains in initial development.

### 2.20 Decision: freeze the production 0.1.x browser feature ceiling

During alpha development, the package uses the moving Browserslist query
`baseline widely available`. This permits ordinary portability corrections as
the package is extracted and tested without pretending that an unfinished
prerelease has already frozen a historical browser set.

At the production release-freeze gate, replace that moving query with
`baseline widely available on` followed by the actual UTC calendar date of the
accepted production-cutover release freeze. The same evidence commit **MUST** record:

- the exact query string containing that date;
- the resolved browser/version set;
- the Browserslist, Baseline/browser-compatibility data and related resolver
  versions used to calculate it; and
- the source commit and date on which the public JavaScript feature ceiling was
  frozen.

That dated query is the maximum JavaScript/web-platform feature level for the
entire 0.1.x line. Later dependency or implementation changes may improve
older-browser behaviour but **MUST NOT** require a feature newer than the frozen
ceiling without a separately approved zero-major feature-line decision.

The ceiling applies to every public entry point and the complete reachable
production graph, including lazily loaded RDF/XML, N3-family, JSON-LD and XML
fallback paths. Package production source is distributed as native JavaScript;
`owlapi` does not transpile syntax, ship browser polyfills, or advertise a
browser that is reachable only through undeclared consumer transformations.
The Chromium, Firefox and WebKit revisions installed by exact
`@playwright/test@1.62.1` remain blocking runtime tests under §§2.16.1 and 2.54.
Branded, historical and physical-device results remain
transparent non-blocking evidence and do not redefine the frozen syntax/API
ceiling.

### 2.21 Decision: support bundlers and document import maps as complementary browser paths

The package supports two browser consumption modes over the same unconditional
native-ESM source and the same five public package specifiers:

1. **Bundler consumption is primary.** A standards-conforming package-aware
   bundler resolves the npm `exports` map, direct dependencies and lazy imports.
   WebVOWL uses this path through Vite.
2. **Native document ESM with an application-owned import map is secondary but
   supported.** The consuming HTML document maps `owlapi`,
   `owlapi/apibinding`, `owlapi/model`, `owlapi/io` and `owlapi/formats`, plus
   the traced runtime dependency closure, to version-pinned browser-loadable
   module URLs.

The import map belongs to the application because its base URL, CSP, hosting
layout, shared dependency versions, caching and integrity policy are
application-wide decisions. `owlapi` therefore supplies a generated, tested
reference example but does not install a global map, publish a universal map as
package metadata, or introduce a sixth public subpath. The example is merged
inline into the consuming document as required by the HTML import-map model.

Phase 19 uses exact `@jspm/generator@2.16.3` under §2.46 as release/development
tooling to trace static imports and statically analyzable literal `import()`
calls from the packed package. Its provider is `jspm.io`, its environment is
`production`/`browser`/`module`, and integrity metadata is mandatory. The exact
generator version and development-dependency/configuration diff remain subject
to the configuration approval in §17.26.1. Neither the generator nor provider
is a production dependency or a URL hard-coded into package source.

The reference path **MUST** prove the actual accepted capability surface rather
than a reduced no-build edition. Its Chromium, Firefox and WebKit fixture imports
all five public specifiers and performs representative public-manager loads for
an OWL-native syntax, RDF/XML, Turtle and JSON-LD so the principal static and
lazy dependency paths execute. It also verifies that the reference map is
version-pinned, contains complete provider integrity metadata, agrees with the
public-export and production-closure registries, has retrievable public URLs and
executes through the integrity-verified local mirror without
`es-module-shims`.

This support claim does not mean that an arbitrary raw npm `node_modules` tree
can be exposed over HTTP without preparation. In the accepted Phase 18 graph,
`rdfxml-streaming-parser` and the non-native XML fallback have CommonJS entry
points, while the selected N3 deep path is its UMD build even though N3 supplies
an ESM build. Import maps resolve specifiers; they do not translate CommonJS or
UMD into ESM. Phase 19 may make the minimal tested N3 ESM-path correction. The
reference map may point the CommonJS-dependent seams at audited ESM conversions
from the selected provider, but the package **MUST NOT** acquire a hand-vendored
dependency bundle, a hidden second implementation, or a CDN-specific source
branch merely to claim raw-tree compatibility. A future CDN-neutral raw-tree
claim requires its own dependency, licence/SBOM, reproducibility and maintenance
decision.

Document import maps do not apply to workers or worklets. Dedicated module
workers are nevertheless part of the 0.1.0 support surface through the primary
bundler path. The installed-package Playwright app **MUST** exercise
representative manager ingestion inside a bundled `DedicatedWorker` in all three
required engines, including XML and a lazy RDF syntax. Because `DOMParser` is a
Window-only API and the current XML fallback is CommonJS behind a Vite-ignored
dynamic import, Phase 19 must first preserve a failing worker regression and
then provide the smallest portable private-adapter correction. Shared workers,
service workers and worklets are not implied by the dedicated-worker claim.

Neither supported browser mode authorizes environment-conditioned package
exports, CommonJS, an IIFE/global build, a turnkey CDN distribution, package
transpilation, or package polyfills. A future delivery form requires a separate
consumer need and design decision.

### 2.22 Decision: npm is authoritative and every other ecosystem receives an explicit status

npm is the authoritative package manager and registry workflow for 0.1.0. It
owns deterministic installation, the canonical lockfile, production dependency
inventory, audit, packing, registry publication, provenance, fresh-cache
verification and WebVOWL's exact installed dependency. Release evidence uses
npm commands; a result from another package manager cannot substitute for an npm
gate.

The README, compatibility data and release notes use exactly these environment
statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `SUPPORTED` | The named environment and consumption mode are part of the declared contract, run in blocking release verification where applicable, and may block a release for a reproducible package defect. |
| `PLAUSIBLE_UNVERIFIED` | The standards/package metadata suggest compatibility, but the project runs no complete required matrix and makes no release-blocking runtime promise. |
| `OUT_OF_SCOPE` | The project makes no 0.1.0 compatibility claim, does not provide environment-specific integration, and does not treat that environment's failure alone as a package defect. |

The initial matrix is:

| Environment or workflow | 0.1.0 status |
| --- | --- |
| Node 22 and Node 24 native ESM through npm on the §2.57 Ubuntu x64, Windows x64 and macOS arm64 representatives | `SUPPORTED` |
| Other upstream-supported Node OS/architecture combinations | `PLAUSIBLE_UNVERIFIED` |
| Browser `Window`/document through a package-aware bundler | `SUPPORTED` |
| Browser document through the §2.21 application-owned import-map path | `SUPPORTED` |
| Bundled dedicated module worker through the §2.21 tested path | `SUPPORTED` |
| Yarn and pnpm installation of the published ESM package | `PLAUSIBLE_UNVERIFIED` |
| Node 26 while it remains Current rather than LTS | `PLAUSIBLE_UNVERIFIED` non-blocking probe |
| Bun, Deno, Cloudflare Workers, React Native and Electron-specific integration | `OUT_OF_SCOPE` |
| CommonJS `require()`, AMD/UMD globals and classic-script/IIFE loading | `OUT_OF_SCOPE` |
| Raw HTTP serving of the npm dependency tree without an ESM-capable resolution/conversion preparation step | `OUT_OF_SCOPE` |

Yarn or pnpm can expose a genuine standards-level package defect even though
their complete workflows are unverified. A report that demonstrates an invalid
`package.json`, broken `exports`, missing packed file, undeclared dependency or
other npm/ESM contract violation remains actionable. Package-manager-specific
lockfile, Plug'n'Play, workspace, lifecycle or resolver behaviour is not a
0.1.0 release obligation unless the same defect reproduces inside the declared
contract or the project separately promotes that workflow to `SUPPORTED`.

The status labels describe tested project commitments, not a claim that an
out-of-scope runtime cannot work. Adding support later requires an environment-
specific consumer test, documented limitations, maintenance ownership and the
ordinary configuration approval; it must not be inferred from one successful
ad hoc execution.

### 2.23 Decision: publish canonical readable ESM source without a duplicate distribution build

The canonical `Hadden-Industries/owlapi` repository root is both the source root
and the npm package root. The retained tarball **MUST** install the same readable
native-ESM production modules reviewed at the signed source tag. It **MUST NOT**
introduce a parallel `src/`→`dist/` compilation or copying pipeline, generated
production JavaScript, minification, package transpilation or source maps for
`0.1.0-alpha.0` or `0.1.0`.

The installed production tree therefore has this conceptual shape:

```text
package.json
index.js
apibinding/
model/
io/
formats/
internal/
README.md
API.md
CHANGELOG.md
LICENSE
NOTICE
docs/compatibility/
```

The four Java-shaped public directories contain each public binding's sole
canonical definition and explicit facade. `internal/` contains the readable
private runtime dependency closure and is present because the exported modules
need it, but package `exports` does not make it an importable public subpath.
There is no second compiled copy of either tree. This makes source review,
debugging, packed-file comparison and AGPL Corresponding Source identification
direct rather than requiring a generated-to-authored mapping whose only result
would be equivalent JavaScript.

The root `package.json` `files` field **MUST** be a positive allowlist. It admits
only the public and private production JavaScript closure plus the exact
documentation set in §2.24; package-governance tests prove every export target
and transitive runtime-relative import is included and every forbidden
development/release artifact in §17.26.2 is excluded. npm's automatic inclusion
of `package.json`, README and licence does not replace the explicit reviewed
allowlist or retained-tarball inspection. See the
[npm `files` contract](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/configuring-npm/package-json/#files)
and [Node package-entry-point guidance](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#package-entry-points).
Where production directories retain colocated `*.test.js` files during the
history-preserving handoff, ordered trailing negations in `files` exclude them;
the selected release npm/`npm-packlist` version must prove those exact semantics.
A test-only helper that does not match the reviewed negative patterns must move
under the repository-only top-level `test/` tree or receive its own explicit
negative entry. Do not add scattered nested `.npmignore` files as a second,
harder-to-audit packlist policy.

The repository `package-lock.json`, the §2.50 third-party-material evidence and
every release/development tool remain outside this allowlist. No publishable
shrinkwrap or bundled dependency payload is introduced: the package's ordinary
external runtime-dependency boundary is governed by §2.48 and independently
checked against both locked and lockless consumer graphs.

Repository scripts may expose explicitly invoked commands such as tests, lint,
documentation verification and release checks. The published manifest **MUST
NOT**, however, define automatically invoked install/pack/publish hooks such as
`preinstall`, `install`, `postinstall`, `prepare`, `prepack`, `postpack`,
`prepublish` or `prepublishOnly`. The release workflow executes named gates
explicitly before building the retained tarball; consumer installation and
packing therefore do not execute package-controlled source generation, network
access or mutation.

### 2.24 Decision: ship a bounded, version-matched documentation set

The npm tarball **MUST** contain exactly the following public-consumer documents
in addition to production JavaScript and `package.json`:

```text
README.md
API.md
CHANGELOG.md
LICENSE
NOTICE
docs/compatibility/capabilities.json
docs/compatibility/java-api-surface.json
docs/compatibility/java-api-surface.md
```

Their responsibilities are deliberately non-overlapping:

- `README.md` provides project identity and rationale, installation, supported
  workflows and environments, representative examples, format/capability
  summary, known limitations, Java OWLAPI relationship and durable policy links;
- `API.md` is the exhaustive version-specific consumer reference governed by
  §2.25;
- `CHANGELOG.md` is a human-curated account of user-visible changes, controlled
  corrections/deviations, deprecations and compatibility consequences for each
  published version;
- `LICENSE` contains the complete unmodified GNU AGPLv3 text;
- `NOTICE` is the mechanically checked §2.50 human view of tarball-applicable
  ownership, stewardship, attribution, embedded/copied-material notices and the
  separate external-dependency/application distribution boundaries; and
- the three `docs/compatibility/` files provide the exact machine-readable
  capability surface, machine-readable Java compatibility/gap projection and
  its generated or mechanically checked human view for the installed version.

The compatibility files are shipped because they are small, version-specific
and central to `owlapi`'s declared identity as a JavaScript-native,
behaviourally compatible Java OWLAPI subset. They let a Java OWLAPI developer or
tool discover an installed version's exact coverage without consulting the
canonical repository's later default-branch state. They are package data and
documentation, not additional JavaScript export paths.

Repository policy, engineering history and release evidence remain canonical
only in the repository and **MUST NOT** enter the tarball. This includes
`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, implementation plans,
migration playbooks/lessons, detailed provenance/history-partition research,
conformance and benchmark evidence, extended-environment reports, workflows and
release runbooks. The README links to the canonical repository versions where
appropriate. In particular, mutable security-support and conduct/contribution
policy must not masquerade as updated content inside an immutable old package.
npm renders the root README belonging to each published version and strongly
recommends it as the package's primary orientation document; see
[npm's package README guidance](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-package-readme-files/).

### 2.25 Decision: derive the API reference from registries and executable exports

`API.md` **MUST** be a mechanically governed human view of the same public
surface proven by the retained package. It is not a manually drifting second API
inventory and does not create a TypeDoc, generated-JSDoc website, GitHub Pages
site or other documentation-hosting product for `0.1.0-alpha.0` or `0.1.0`.

Authority remains deliberately layered rather than duplicated:

```text
capabilities.json
    semantic capability/status authority
            │
            ├──────────────────────┐
            ▼                      ▼
java-api-surface.json      package exports + installed tests
    Java/API projection       executable boundary evidence
            │                      │
            └──────────┬───────────┘
                       ▼
          API.md + java-api-surface.md
          generated/mechanically checked views
```

For every public binding, `API.md` **MUST** identify:

- the exact public package specifier and named export;
- its JavaScript constructor, function or method call shape in JavaScript
  notation rather than pseudo-TypeScript;
- the corresponding Java OWLAPI package/type/method where one exists;
- the approved compatibility relationship, capability status and stability
  classification;
- accepted inputs and observable return-value semantics;
- relevant identity, equality, mutability, collection, ordering and lifecycle
  semantics;
- public error classes/codes and material environment/resource qualifications;
  and
- a minimal public-boundary JavaScript example plus the corresponding Java idiom
  where it materially assists Java OWLAPI users.

Package governance **MUST** prove that every packed named export appears exactly
once in the API inventory, every API row resolves to the surface registry and
capability matrix, and no internal-only binding is described as public. Example
programs used to establish call behaviour must execute against the retained
tarball through public specifiers; they may not depend on repository-relative,
workspace or unexported paths. Human behavioural prose may be authored for
clarity, but an executable inventory/export disagreement or stale registry link
blocks publication.

### 2.26 Decision: do not ship TypeScript declarations; permit only separately authorized future exploration

`owlapi@0.1.0-alpha.0` and `owlapi@0.1.0` are deliberately native JavaScript
packages without an official TypeScript declaration surface. Their package
manifests **MUST NOT** contain `types` or `typings`; their tarballs **MUST NOT**
contain `.d.ts` files; and this project **MUST NOT** publish or advertise an
official `@types/owlapi` substitute for those releases. An empty, partial or
`any`-based declaration is forbidden because it would create false compile-time
confidence rather than a supported contract.

JSDoc may continue to explain runtime semantics, but Phase 19/20 **MUST NOT** add
TypeScript, `tsc`, `checkJs`, TypeDoc, declaration generation or declaration-test
tooling. The README and environment/capability data must say plainly that
official TypeScript declarations are not part of the `0.1.0` support surface.

This decision does not attempt to predict whether some future consumers would
find declarations valuable. TypeScript documents that declaration generation
from JavaScript requires real JSDoc typing plus a TypeScript development
dependency, compiler configuration and an emitted declaration set; see
[Creating `.d.ts` files from JavaScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/dts-from-js.html)
and [Publishing declarations](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/publishing.html).
The present structural API has not undergone that type-design exercise, and no
such exercise is a deliverable or backlog item in this plan or the lifecycle
capability plan.

Only if the repository owner later identifies demonstrated consumer demand may
a separately authorized, non-implementing exploration compare handwritten,
JavaScript-derived and community-maintained external declaration approaches,
including their synchronization and compatibility risks. Such an exploration
produces options and a recommendation only: it creates no source,
configuration, metadata, declarations, release promise or reserved version.
Any implementation would require a new explicit architecture decision,
configuration approval and implementation plan; it must not be added
opportunistically as package metadata.

### 2.27 Decision: make the registry-classified public surface the disciplined 0.1 compatibility contract

The prerelease surface remains subject to the documented alpha qualification.
In the accepted production cutover version, every public binding accepted by
§17.27.1 **MUST** have the
`INITIAL_DEVELOPMENT` stability commitment in the Public API Surface Registry;
deprecated retained public bindings use `DEPRECATED_INITIAL_DEVELOPMENT`. Private
implementation values retain `INTERNAL_ONLY` exposure and a `null` stability
value. These dimensions are distinct from semantic capability status: a
capability may be deferred without turning an internal implementation fragment
into public API.

The documented 0.1 compatibility contract comprises:

- the five public package specifiers and their named-export identities;
- every registry binding classified `INITIAL_DEVELOPMENT` or
  `DEPRECATED_INITIAL_DEVELOPMENT`;
- documented constructors, methods, accepted argument forms and return-value
  semantics;
- documented public `kind` identifiers and structural properties;
- documented identity, equality, immutability and collection semantics;
- public error classes, machine-readable error codes and causal-error
  preservation;
- documented loader configuration and security/resource defaults; and
- the standards-conformant semantic behaviour, capability statuses and
  controlled deviations promised for each supported format.

The following are expressly not public contract unless an API row says
otherwise:

- unexported filesystem paths and all internal classes/functions/adapters;
- internal dependency, parser-selection, traversal, storage, caching and
  indexing choices;
- incidental constructor names or `instanceof` relationships;
- undocumented properties and implementation-only return details;
- dependency versions as consumer API;
- stack traces and exact human diagnostic wording; and
- blank-node identifiers, iteration order, object-key order or byte-level
  serialization layout that no public contract explicitly promises.

After `0.1.0`, backwards-compatible corrections use unused patch coordinates
beginning with `0.1.1`. A material new public binding or capability advances to
the next available zero-major feature coordinate, expected to be `0.2.0`; it is
never disguised as a patch. An incompatibly changed or removed documented
binding also requires the next available `0.minor.0` compatibility boundary. If
an intervening incompatible correction consumes `0.2.0`, the separately planned
lifecycle feature programme advances to the next available zero-major feature
coordinate rather than absorbing unrelated work merely to retain its number.

A behaviour already classified as a known deviation, unsupported case or defect
may be corrected in a patch when the correction restores the documented
standards/API contract, is protected by a failing regression and normative
evidence, and is recorded as a controlled correction in `CHANGELOG.md` and the
release notes. Behaviour that the registry and API reference classify as part
of the current 0.minor contract cannot be changed incompatibly in a patch merely
by relabelling the change a bug fix; it requires the next zero-major
compatibility boundary.

Deprecation is documentary and registry-visible. A deprecated binding remains
operational throughout its current 0.minor patch line, identifies its
replacement and migration guidance in `API.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` and release
notes, and may be removed only at a later explicitly reviewed zero-major
compatibility boundary. The package **MUST NOT** emit unsolicited `console.warn`
messages or introduce another import/runtime side effect merely to announce a
deprecation.

### 2.28 Decision: establish bounded single-custodian npm authority for this plan

The public unscoped coordinate is bootstrapped once by the npm user
`maksymshostak`. This is an identity fact, not a claim that the package is a
personal rather than company-stewarded project: HADDEN INDUSTRIES LTD remains
the project steward and `Hadden-Industries/owlapi` remains the canonical source
and release repository. The bootstrap **MUST NOT** be performed through a shared
generic company login.

Immediately after the first successful publication, the project **MUST** test
whether npm permits the dedicated `@hadden-industries:owlapi-maintainers` team
to receive read-write access to the unscoped package. The exact command/API,
registry response, effective-access verification and resulting maintainership
state **MUST** be retained as release evidence. If the registry supports that
arrangement, the team receives the least privilege needed for package
maintenance, but its only required natural-person member for this plan is Maksym
Shostak. If npm does not support that arrangement, the limitation is recorded
rather than concealed behind an inaccurate ownership claim.

No second natural-person npm maintainer, GitHub custodian or recovery operator is
an alpha, production-release or plan-completion requirement. `maksymshostak` remains
the sole required human npm identity through `0.1.0`; shared passwords, tokens,
mailbox-backed pseudo-persons and generic company logins remain prohibited. This
is a deliberate acceptance of single-person availability and account-recovery
risk, not evidence of redundancy. Documentation **MUST NOT** say that the npm
organization or juridical person owns or can recover the coordinate unless npm's
effective registry state actually establishes that fact. Adding another human
custodian is separately governed post-plan work.

The bootstrap alpha may use only the single-attempt, one-day granular access
token authorized by §§2.53 and 17.26.3. Its recorded effective scope must be the
narrowest npm actually permits for the not-yet-created package, its
non-interactive bypass-2FA authority ends with immediate revocation after the
attempt, and its `npm-release` environment secret is removed. Before any later
public release, npm **MUST** be configured for the exact
`Hadden-Industries/owlapi` repository, `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow
and `npm-release` protected environment
as a stage-only OIDC trusted publisher, ordinary package-token publication
**MUST** be disabled, and interactive 2FA approval **MUST** protect promotion of
the staged release after the §2.53 download-and-digest gate. Custody evidence
therefore proves the actual single named human authority and bounded machine
authority; it **MUST NOT** claim organizational or multi-person continuity.

### 2.29 Decision: treat npm distribution tags as explicit release channels

An npm distribution tag is a mutable registry pointer, not a version or a
historical record. Every tag mutation is therefore a separately authorized and
recorded release operation whose before/after registry state **MUST** be
verified.

The initial `0.1.0-alpha.0` and any later alpha or release candidate **MUST** be
published under `next`; prerelease publication **MUST NOT** create or move
`latest`. The accepted production cutover version—normally `0.1.0`, or solely its
§2.60 same-surface successor—**MUST** be the first Hadden Industries version
published under `latest`. Once that production package has passed registry
re-download and consumer verification, `next` **MUST** be removed if it still
points at an older prerelease and there is no genuinely newer active prerelease
channel. It **MUST NOT** be repointed to the production cutover merely to preserve a second
alias for the same production version. Only the §2.33 recovery procedure may later
move or remove `latest` in response to a verified bad release.

`next` is recreated only when a real future prerelease is published. No
`alpha`, `beta`, `rc`, `stable`, `legacy` or other speculative tag is created
until the project has an actual maintained release channel requiring it. This
keeps ordinary `npm install owlapi`, deliberate prerelease installation and
historical exact-version installation semantically distinct.

### 2.30 Decision: protect one trunk and immutable release tags without ceremonial process

`main` is the sole default and standing integration branch. Work is performed
on short-lived topic branches and accepted through pull requests. The
repository **MUST** use squash merging so each accepted pull request becomes one
reviewed, human-curated commit with an accurate durable message; force pushes
and deletion of `main` are prohibited.

The `main` ruleset **MUST** require the exact stable `CI / required` check from
the GitHub Actions app under §2.58 and require CodeQL separately, plus resolved
review conversations and linear history. It applies to administrators and
exposes only a narrow, auditable emergency bypass. It does not enumerate
matrix-generated job names, accept an unexpected skipped check or use path
filters to make required automation optional. Maksym Shostak is the only code
reviewer required throughout this implementation plan, so the ruleset **MUST
NOT** manufacture independence through self-approval or make the repository
unusable by demanding an unavailable reviewer. Any later requirement for an
independent approving review and stale-approval dismissal is a separate
post-plan governance/configuration decision made only when a genuine second code
maintainer exists.

A separate `v*` tag ruleset **MUST** prevent release-tag update and deletion and
restrict tag creation to the release authority. The project initially relies on
the signed annotated release tag, GitHub Actions provenance and retained
artefacts for source-release authenticity; it does not impose a blanket
signed-commit requirement on every contribution. There is no permanent
`develop`, speculative release branch or pre-created version branch. A maintenance
branch is introduced only when concurrent maintained release lines create a
real need for it.

### 2.31 Decision: humans author releases; automation verifies and transports them

`CHANGELOG.md` is a human-curated release record with an `Unreleased` section,
dated version sections, compare links, compatibility impact, deprecations and
controlled deviations. Every public prerelease and production release starts with a
dedicated release pull request that selects the exact version and finalizes the
changelog, API reference, compatibility declarations, evidence index and
package metadata together.

An implementer may run `npm version <exact-version> --no-git-tag-version` to
synchronize the manifest and lockfile, but **MUST** review the resulting diff and
commit it through that pull request. The accepted release commit is then
dispatched through §2.60's deterministic late-tag gate. Only after that gate
reaches its prescribed human boundary is the same commit tagged separately with
the signed annotated tag. Release automation **MUST** verify that the tag,
manifest, lockfile, documentation and evidence agree and that the tracked tree
is unchanged; it **MUST NOT** edit tracked files, select or bump a version,
create a commit or tag, or improvise release notes.

The GitHub release description is curated from the accepted changelog and
evidence rather than generated as an unreviewed substitute. Changesets,
release-please, semantic-release, mandatory Conventional Commits and equivalent
release-authoring machinery are deliberately deferred until demonstrated
release volume justifies their additional policy surface.

### 2.32 Decision: exact-pin foundational runtime semantics and automate proposals only

The package's direct runtime dependencies—`@rdfjs/data-model`,
`@rdfjs/dataset`, `@xmldom/xmldom`, `jsonld`, `n3` and
`rdfxml-streaming-parser`—participate directly in public parsing, RDF or
document semantics. Their accepted versions **MUST** therefore be exact values
in `package.json` and the lockfile rather than ranges. The lockfile remains an
installation/release integrity control; it does not excuse a ranged public
manifest. Under §2.48 it also remains repository-only: deterministic release
testing does not turn this reusable library into a shrinkwrapped, bundled or
peer-supplied dependency deployment.

The Phase 19 initial-package baseline is:

| Runtime dependency | Exact version |
| --- | --- |
| `@rdfjs/data-model` | `2.1.2` |
| `@rdfjs/dataset` | `2.0.3` |
| `@xmldom/xmldom` | `0.9.12` |
| `jsonld` | `9.0.0` |
| `n3` | `2.3.0` |
| `rdfxml-streaming-parser` | `3.3.0` |

These values replace the earlier staging baselines wherever the initial package
manifest is illustrated. On 24 August 2026, the three version advances were
applied to WebVOWL together as one explicitly approved, coordinated staging
change rather than deferred to package extraction. Acceptance still retained
dependency-specific conformance, adapter, resource, browser and performance
evidence inside the combined gate: all focused suites passed, the production
audit remained clear, the browser boundaries remained lazy, and N3.js 2.3.0
promoted 12 former TriG exclusions to required passing cases. The table therefore
records a demonstrated staging baseline, not an unqualified release target.

That one bootstrap qualification does not establish a general batching policy.
Any later replacement remains an isolated §2.32 dependency update and must
complete the same gates before changing the literal manifest and lockfile values.

Each foundational runtime update **MUST** be isolated in its own pull request
and run every relevant conformance, differential, Node, browser, WebVOWL,
security, resource, performance and packed-consumer gate. It may not be grouped
with another foundational runtime update merely because both are available.
Security urgency bypasses any batching or scheduling delay, never the gates or
human review.

The canonical repository **MUST** enable Dependabot alerts, security updates and
weekly version-update proposals. Runtime dependencies remain separate;
compatible development-tool updates may be grouped; development-tool majors
remain separate; and GitHub Actions updates form their own group. Third-party
Actions **MUST** be pinned to a full commit SHA with a nearby comment naming the
human-readable upstream release tag. Dependabot may propose replacement SHAs,
but no dependency or workflow update is auto-merged, and Renovate is not run in
parallel for the same responsibility.

The separately approved §2.48 lockless `owlapi@latest` monitor complements
Dependabot: Dependabot tests proposed declared updates, while the monitor detects
consumer-visible changes arising from a freshly resolved transitive graph. Both
may create review work; neither may mutate or publish package state.

Closing an alert or merging an update pull request is not the completion of a
consumer-affecting security correction. When the installed dependency is part
of a published vulnerable package, the accepted fixed version, required
evidence and corrected dependency graph **MUST** reach a new published `owlapi`
version under the applicable release process.

### 2.33 Decision: correct bad public releases without erasing ordinary history

A published `name@version`, signed source tag and immutable GitHub release are
historical facts. An ordinary defect, regression, incompatibility or public
vulnerability **MUST NOT** be handled by replacing release assets, moving or
deleting the source tag, republishing the coordinate, rewriting its evidence or
unpublishing a version that consumers may have locked. The correction is a new
SemVer version built and verified through the complete release process.

For the remainder of this plan, the **production cutover version** is exactly
`0.1.0` except for two closed branches. If §2.60 abandons immutable `v0.1.0`
after a deterministic post-tag/prepublication failure, the lowest available
same-surface patch, initially `0.1.1`, becomes the first production release. Otherwise, only
when `0.1.0` has already been published and then fails a mandatory
post-publication registry, provenance, package or consumer verification may the
lowest available corrective patch become the production cutover. Each substitute
must pass every production-release gate. Neither contingency can be used to skip, rename or
casually replace the approved normal first production release; its activation, reason and
resulting coordinate are separately authorized and recorded.

The immediate containment action depends on the affected channel:

- when a `next` prerelease is defective, move `next` back to the most recent
  genuinely supported prerelease, or remove `next` when none exists;
- when a production release is defective and a known-good Hadden Industries production release
  exists, move `latest` back to that exact version while the correction is
  prepared; and
- when initial production `0.1.0` is defective and no earlier Hadden Industries
  production release exists, remove `latest` temporarily. It **MUST NOT** point to the
  unrelated historical `1.0.0` or another former Overwatch coordinate.

Deprecate the defective exact version with concise actionable guidance when the
warning can be public safely. The message identifies the affected version and
fixed/recommended coordinate or mitigation; it does not make an unsupported
compatibility claim or prematurely disclose embargoed vulnerability details.
Once the corrected version passes fresh-registry and consumer verification,
assign the applicable active tag to it and verify the final channel state.

Every deprecation, undeprecation and distribution-tag change is a separately
authorized mutable registry operation. Evidence records its reason, actor,
authorization, UTC timestamp, before/after metadata and related incident/fix.
The immutable source/tarball/SBOM/checksum/release evidence remains unchanged.

Unpublishing is an extraordinary incident response reserved for accidentally
published secrets or private/confidential material, malicious contents, a legal
requirement, or npm/another competent platform authority directing removal. It
requires case-specific authorization, npm/GitHub Support or legal coordination
where applicable, and a record that the coordinate remains permanently consumed
and locked consumers may break. When confidentiality, safety or law requires
removing otherwise immutable public evidence, that exceptional action and the
loss of ordinary reproducibility are documented to the maximum safe extent; the
normal bad-release procedure is never used as a pretext for erasing history.

### 2.34 Decision: separate audit visibility from a strict, reviewable release gate

Every release candidate **MUST** retain both:

1. a full dependency-graph `npm audit --json` result covering production and
   development dependencies; and
2. a blocking production-tree result equivalent to
   `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` against the exact accepted lockfile.

The first preserves complete visibility; the second gives the release gate a
deterministic minimum threshold. An unavailable audit service is retried and
diagnosed but is not converted into a passing or `NOT_RUN` result for a public
release. Audit output is evidence, not an instruction to mutate the tree.
`npm audit fix`, `npm audit fix --force` and equivalent automatic remediation
**MUST NOT** run against release inputs; corrections use the exact-pin,
one-foundational-runtime-per-pull-request process in §2.32.

The canonical pull-request checks **MUST** also run GitHub dependency review,
pin its Action to a full commit SHA, and fail when a proposed dependency change
introduces a known `high` or `critical` runtime vulnerability. The source diff,
manifest and lockfile still receive human review because the platform may not
classify every dependency change.

A `high` or `critical` production advisory blocks publication unless the project
proves it is a false positive or inapplicable to every supported public
operation. A reachable critical vulnerability has no ordinary risk-acceptance
exception. A high/critical development advisory also blocks when the affected
functionality can execute in required CI, tests, packing, SBOM/provenance work,
publication or another release trust boundary. Moderate/low findings and
non-release-reachable development findings remain visible and owned but do not
automatically block.

Every allowed advisory exception is machine-readable and records the GHSA/CVE,
exact dependency path/version, severity, runtime/development scope, supported-
operation reachability analysis, input/trust boundary, compensating controls,
responsible maintainer, linked tracking issue, approval/review date and an expiry
no later than 30 calendar days. It is revalidated for every release and cannot
be renewed by silence. Public release evidence identifies an active exception
without leaking an embargoed report; the private advisory retains sensitive
details until coordinated disclosure.

### 2.35 Decision: require deliberate single-custodian human release approval

Every automated npm bootstrap publication or steady-state stage creation, plus
every automated deprecation and distribution-tag write, waits at the protected
`npm-release` GitHub environment for an explicit human approval of the exact
package/version, retained tarball SHA-256, fixed source commit, expected or
existing source tag, registry and requested npm tag/operation. For a steady-state
release, that environment approval authorizes only creation of the non-public
stage; the later public promotion requires separate inspection of the immutable
staged candidate, a now-existing verified canonical tag and interactive npm 2FA.

The no-authority `release-manual` environment in §2.61 supplies two distinct
continuation acknowledgements without authorizing an npm or GitHub write: one
after the human has created the signed tag in every release, and one after the
human has interactively promoted an npm stage in steady state. Automatic
approval and unattended publication are prohibited. The authenticated review
history, approving identity and ordering become release evidence together with
the reviewed coordinate and operation.

For this initial release programme, `MaksymShostak` is the sole required GitHub
reviewer and may initiate the workflow and approve both `npm-release` and
`release-manual`; the `maksymshostak` npm identity performs npm's staged
proof-of-presence approval. GitHub's prevent-self-review control **MUST NOT** be
enabled as a Phase 19/20 completion requirement. No second-person approval,
custody or recovery requirement may be inferred elsewhere in this plan.

This choice changes separation of duties, not the number or quality of release
gates: all checks, the immutable candidate, recorded manual pauses, OIDC authority and
fresh-registry verification remain required. Moving later to independent
deployment approval requires a separately approved threat-model and exact
environment-configuration change; it is not triggered automatically by account
membership.

### 2.36 Decision: sign release tags with SSH and govern signer-key continuity

Every release tag is an SSH-signed annotated tag made by an authorized natural
person after the release pull request is accepted and the applicable §2.60
pre-tag gates have completed. SSH is selected because the current project
history already demonstrates GitHub-verified SSH signing; Phase
19 **MUST** reverify the intended key rather than infer authority solely from
that history. The project does not introduce a parallel GPG release-key system
without a separately demonstrated need.

The canonical repository **MUST** maintain the repository-only machine-readable
`docs/provenance/release-signers.json`, excluded from the npm tarball. Its
versioned schema records for every current or historical signer:

```text
stable signer identifier
natural-person name
GitHub and npm identities
SSH public key and fingerprint
valid-from date
optional valid-until/revocation date
ACTIVE, RETIRED or REVOKED status
rotation/revocation rationale and evidence link where applicable
```

The release workflow builds a temporary SSH allowed-signers file from the
accepted registry and runs local cryptographic tag verification. It also proves
that the tag is annotated, targets the exact accepted `main` release commit,
uses a signer already admitted before the release pull request, and is reported
as verified by GitHub. A release pull request **MUST NOT** authorize its own new
signer.

Adding or rotating a signer is a separate reviewed change completed before that
key is used. Historical entries and validity intervals remain so old releases
stay verifiable; revocation changes prospective authority and does not rewrite
old tags. The private key remains individually controlled, passphrase-protected
or hardware-backed, covered by tested recovery/revocation procedures, and never
copied into GitHub Actions. OIDC authorizes the workflow's npm write; it does not
replace the human tag signature, and the tag key is not an npm credential.

### 2.37 Decision: use structured GitHub intake without inventing support machinery

GitHub Issues in `Hadden-Industries/owlapi` are the sole ordinary public support,
bug, conformance and capability-request channel. The repository does not publish
a generic support email address and initially leaves GitHub Discussions
disabled. `security@haddenindustries.com` remains restricted to private
vulnerability reporting, while `conduct@haddenindustries.com` remains restricted
to private conduct reports. Ordinary support is best-effort and has no response-
time SLA.

The repository **MUST** provide structured issue forms for:

1. reproducible bug or regression;
2. syntax/conformance discrepancy;
3. Java OWLAPI compatibility or public-surface request;
4. feature/capability request;
5. documentation problem; and
6. a minimal other-project-issue escape hatch.

Completely blank issues are disabled because the final form preserves novel
reports while still collecting minimum actionable context. Every form warns
against posting confidential ontologies, credentials, vulnerability details or
personal conduct information and links to the correct private policy. Bug and
conformance forms request the exact `owlapi` version, public specifier/call,
runtime/browser, syntax/format, minimal safe input or reproduction, expected and
actual result, diagnostic and relevant specification/test identifier. The Java
compatibility form additionally requests the exact Java OWLAPI version,
package/type/member, desired JavaScript shape, concrete consumer use case and
related Public API Surface Registry row.

The pull-request template prompts for test-first or characterization evidence as
applicable, independent-implementation/provenance confirmation, public-API and
capability-registry effects, SemVer classification, documentation/changelog and
controlled-deviation impact, dependency changes and verification commands. Its
checkboxes are engineering aids, not a CLA, DCO or legal click-wrap substitute.

Phase 19 does not add `CODEOWNERS` while meaningful code ownership and review
routing remain effectively one person. Add it only when real module ownership or
an active second code-review responsibility exists. Discussions, another support
system or a support mailbox likewise require demonstrated demand and a separate
governance/configuration decision.

### 2.38 Decision: make the reviewed manifest and registry operation agree on the release channel

`publishConfig` is part of the reviewed release input, not a permanent
prerelease default. Every release pull request **MUST** set all three of these
values explicitly:

```json
{
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public",
    "registry": "https://registry.npmjs.org/",
    "tag": "<SemVer-derived channel>"
  }
}
```

The channel mapping is exact:

| Version kind | Required `publishConfig.tag` | Required explicit publish/stage `--tag` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| alpha, beta or release candidate, including `0.1.0-alpha.0` and `0.1.0-rc.N` | `next` | `next` |
| accepted production, including `0.1.0` and any §2.33 corrective release | `latest` | `latest` |

A required release check derives the expected channel from the package's exact
SemVer and rejects disagreement among the manifest version,
`publishConfig.tag`, `npm-release` environment request, explicit command-line
`--tag`, authorized package coordinate and observed post-publication registry
state. The check runs before human publication approval and again against the
fresh registry result. Omitting `--tag` or relying on npm's implicit default is
not an accepted release path even though the reviewed manifest supplies the
same value defensively.

For the bootstrap alpha, the explicit command is `npm publish ... --tag next`.
For the later OIDC flow, the workflow uses
`npm stage publish ... --tag <channel>`; npm fixes that tag as part of the staged
candidate, and `npm stage approve` does not change it. A staged tag mismatch
therefore requires rejection and a new staged attempt from the same still-valid
retained tarball or, if any release input changed, a new reviewed candidate. It
is never corrected during proof-of-presence approval.

An approved later distribution-tag mutation under §§2.29 or 2.33 changes only
the registry pointer. It does not edit, rebuild or republish the immutable
package whose embedded `publishConfig` correctly records the channel requested
when that version was first published.

### 2.39 Decision: publish exact, honest discovery metadata without ceremonial fields

Every public package version **MUST** use this description and keyword set:

```json
{
  "description": "OWL 2 ontology parsing and structural APIs for Node.js and browsers, designed for practical compatibility with Java OWLAPI concepts.",
  "keywords": [
    "owl",
    "owl2",
    "owlapi",
    "ontology",
    "ontology-parser",
    "semantic-web",
    "linked-data",
    "rdf",
    "rdfjs",
    "rdfxml",
    "turtle",
    "jsonld"
  ]
}
```

The package is not advertised as a reasoner, knowledge-graph platform or
WebVOWL-specific library. WebVOWL is the required first-party consumer, not the
semantic identity of the reusable module.

The initial manifest omits `funding`: an ordinary company, repository or
profile URL is not represented as an actionable sponsorship destination. It
also omits `contributors` until accepted external contributions make a curated
list useful, and omits any invented `maintainers` field because npm registry
access is authoritative for package maintainership. The §2.13 author object
continues to identify Maksym Shostak through his public GitHub URL without an
email. HADDEN INDUSTRIES LTD remains project steward in README/`NOTICE`
language rather than being substituted as author. Adding any omitted field
later requires an actual destination/person/role and a separately reviewed
metadata change.

### 2.40 Decision: keep compact release evidence beyond ephemeral workflow retention

GitHub Actions workflow logs and artifacts are diagnostic transport with a
90-day public-repository retention setting; they are not the canonical release
archive. The canonical evidence for every successfully published version is:

1. the immutable source/tag and release assets fixed by §2.16;
2. an immutable release asset named
   `owlapi-<version>.release-evidence.json`; and
3. an append-only repository record at
   `docs/provenance/releases/<version>/release.json`, excluded from the npm
   tarball.

The release-evidence asset is generated after npm publication and complete
fresh-cache verification but before the draft GitHub release becomes
immutable. Its versioned §2.47 JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 schema records at
least:

```text
package coordinate and requested/observed distribution tag
manual-dispatch ref/commit, captured protected-main head and initial canonical-tag-absence result
source commit/tree and later-created SSH-signed tag
authorized signer identity/fingerprint and verification result
workflow path/blob/commit, run URL/ID/attempt, dispatch actor/ref/commit, later pushed tag/commit and exact Action repositories/release-tag comments/full commit SHAs
effective root/job permission map, npm-release/release-manual protected-main policies, release-manual deployment:false/no-secret/no-variable result and non-cancelling concurrency identity
expected job role, applicability reason, final conclusion and timeout class/configured duration
required-matrix fail-fast/continue policy and aggregate job inventory/result
workflow concurrency group, cancellation and queue mode
controlled idempotent-read retry policy and observed retry counts

canonical-tag creation/verification time and proof that no public promotion or draft-release mutation preceded it
release-manual workflow-review history, reviewer identity, gate count/order/result and corresponding waiting/job-start times
proof that no runner polling or sleep loop substituted for either release-manual acknowledgement
workflow trust origin, fork-run applicability/approval identity/time and external-contributor policy
effective secret-name/OIDC/environment inventory without values and sanitized-output/debug-state result
same-run untrusted-candidate quarantine and proof no fork-produced byte/output reached privileged authority
per-job runs-on label, selected shell, runner OS/architecture, ImageOS/ImageVersion, OS build/kernel and label/architecture verification result
checkout ref/depth/tag/credential-persistence inputs and setup-node exact-version/cache/auth inputs
same-run candidate artefact name/ID/digest, exact upload/download inputs and independent checksum/inventory results
confirmation that no candidate came from another workflow or release cache
Node, npm and all §2.54 npm evidence-tool versions plus lockfile identity
GitHub CLI source/version/official-checksum result and downloaded SHA-256
Phase 19 history-filter source/tag/commit/retrieval URL/downloaded SHA-256; later releases reference that immutable extraction record
separate SBOM tool/subject workspace source, lockfile and production-install identities
publication mode (DIRECT_BOOTSTRAP or OIDC_STAGED) and non-secret authority identity
for DIRECT_BOOTSTRAP: granular-token effective scope, one-day expiry, revocation/secret-removal result and reviewed bootstrap-branch removal, never the token
for OIDC_STAGED: trusted repository/release.yml/npm-release identity, stage ID/view identity, pre-tag staging status and npm-release approving identity/time
for OIDC_STAGED: staged-download SHA-256, retained-tarball SHA-256/equality result, later canonical-tag/release-manual acceptance result and interactive promoting identity/time
for OIDC_STAGED: second release-manual approval after promotion and before fresh-registry verification
tarball filename, SHA-256, npm integrity, byte size and packlist digest
SBOM and SHA256SUMS filenames/digests
locked release and lockless fresh-consumer dependency-graph identities
publint version, input digest, strict result and active exception identifiers
third-party-material inventory/NOTICE review identity
required package/Node/browser/WebVOWL test summaries
extended-test PASS/FAIL/NOT_RUN snapshot
dependency-audit summaries and active exception identifiers
WebVOWL source/candidate-patch identity
npm root-package signature/provenance/publish-attestation and transparency identities
immutable GitHub release, per-asset, checksum, schema and signed-tag results
npm-release mutation approval and release-manual continuation approval identities/times, plus controlled deviations
```

`SHA256SUMS` has exactly the §2.52 entries for the retained tarball and
production SBOM. The
immutable GitHub release attestation covers those assets and the evidence
manifest itself. After the release is published, the repository `release.json`
records the evidence-manifest digest plus the immutable release URL and
attestation identity and exact fresh-download/per-asset verification results
that could not exist beforehand. This post-release record does not change the
release source tag or package bytes.

Once accepted, that `release.json` is not silently rewritten. A factual
correction or later fixed-evidence addition is a new dated file under
`amendments/` that identifies the superseded field, old/new value, reason and
approving commit. A human/generated current summary may project the append-only
record, but the original publication claim remains reviewable.

Later branded, historical or real-device results are new dated files under
`docs/provenance/releases/<version>/extended-tests/`, not rewrites of the
publication-time evidence. A generated or curated version summary may be
updated in a traceable documentation commit, but every earlier observation
remains addressable. Mutable registry operations under §2.33 likewise receive
new timestamped records under the affected version's `registry-operations/`
directory.

No durable public record contains credentials, OTPs, private ontology content,
embargoed advisory material, unrestricted logs, mailbox membership or personal
report data. The release workflow retains only compact results, stable links,
digests and non-sensitive diagnostics needed to reproduce or audit the claim.

### 2.41 Decision: require low-maintenance source and secret scanning at the public repository boundary

The canonical public repository **MUST** enable GitHub CodeQL default setup for
JavaScript with the default query suite. Phase 19 does not introduce a custom
CodeQL workflow, custom configuration or `security-extended` query suite before
the default analysis has run and demonstrated a concrete coverage gap. The
`main` ruleset **MUST** require the CodeQL result and block a pull request when
analysis is absent/incomplete or the changed source introduces a `high` or
`critical` alert. Dependency review remains independently required because it
covers dependency changes and default-setup merge protection does not replace
that gate.

Before the first alpha release, the extracted repository has no unresolved
high or critical CodeQL alert on the accepted source commit. A reachable
critical source finding has no ordinary release exception. A demonstrable
false positive or finding inapplicable to every supported operation may use a
repository-only, machine-readable entry in
`docs/provenance/code-scanning-exceptions.json`, separate from dependency
advisory exceptions. Each entry records the tool/rule and alert URL, exact
source location/commit, severity, reachability/trust-boundary analysis,
false-positive or non-applicability evidence, compensating controls, owner,
tracking issue, approval date and expiry no later than 30 calendar days. It is
revalidated for every release and never renewed silently.

Secret scanning and repository push protection **MUST** be enabled. A bypass is
permitted only for a demonstrated false positive or an intentional non-secret
test value and records the reason. A real credential is never accepted under a
“fix later” rationale: rotate or revoke it immediately, remove it from release
inputs, investigate exposure and follow the applicable incident process.
Deleting the string in a later commit does not make an exposed credential safe.
Custom secret patterns are deferred until an actual organization-specific
credential format requires them.

### 2.42 Decision: make zero telemetry and caller-authorized networking part of the package contract

`owlapi` **MUST NOT** perform telemetry, analytics, usage or crash reporting,
update checks, remote configuration, install pings or automatic diagnostic
uploads. Installing or importing the package performs no network I/O. Manager
creation and parsing local documents perform no network I/O by default.

The only package operation permitted to retrieve a remote document is a
caller's explicit ontology-import or JSON-LD-context request under the §10.8 and
§19.3–19.4 controls. `remoteImports` and `remoteJsonLdContexts` remain `false`
by default; enabled retrieval uses the configured/injected loader, resource
budgets and SSRF/redirect/scheme restrictions. User-directed document
resolution is part of the requested parse operation and is not telemetry.

Diagnostics and ontology contents remain in the caller's process unless the
caller separately transmits them. README/environment documentation **MUST**
state this contract without creating a standalone privacy policy for a library
that collects no data. An executable installed-package test denies or records
the package's network seam and proves that import, manager construction and
representative local OWL-native, RDF/XML and lazy RDF parsing make no outbound
request.

The core remains zero-telemetry throughout every published release line. Any future data-collection
proposal requires explicit opt-in, privacy/legal/security review, separate
public documentation and a compatibility decision; it cannot arrive silently
through a patch or transitive dependency. Prefer a consumer-owned integration
outside the core if such functionality is ever genuinely required.

### 2.43 Decision: make one exact `exports` map the sole package-entry authority

The published manifest **MUST** expose exactly these unconditional native-ESM
entry points:

```json
{
  "type": "module",
  "exports": {
    ".": "./index.js",
    "./apibinding": "./apibinding/index.js",
    "./model": "./model/index.js",
    "./io": "./io/index.js",
    "./formats": "./formats/index.js"
  }
}
```

The target files are the readable canonical source modules fixed by §§2.10.4
and 2.23. The root aggregate may re-export approved bindings from the four
subpaths, but every repeated binding **MUST** have the same runtime identity;
the aggregate does not define a duplicate implementation.

The initial manifest **MUST NOT** define `main`, `module`, `browser`, an
environment condition, a wildcard/pattern export, an extension-bearing alias,
or `./package.json`. It exposes neither the physical public-source filenames nor
any `internal/` path. In particular, `owlapi/model.js`,
`owlapi/model/index.js`, `owlapi/package.json` and `owlapi/*` are not alternate
public spellings. Supporting old Node/package tooling is outside the declared
environment contract and does not justify a redundant fallback entry point.

Package-governance tests **MUST** compare the manifest with the Public API
Surface Registry, import all five exact specifiers, prove the root/subpath
binding identities and require `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` or the equivalent
resolver failure for every representative alias, deep path and metadata path.
Any later public subpath requires a Java-package registry decision and the
normal SemVer/API process; it cannot be admitted through a pattern.

### 2.44 Decision: require import purity and publish `sideEffects: false`

The canonical manifest **MUST** contain:

```json
{
  "sideEffects": false
}
```

This is a behavioural assertion, not an optimistic bundler hint. Importing any
package-owned production module must do nothing externally observable except
define and expose its bindings. Import evaluation **MUST NOT** perform network
or file-system I/O, start timers or workers, register event listeners, write to
the console, read or mutate process environment, mutate a global/prototype,
install a polyfill, register a parser through ambient state, or trigger a lazy
third-party implementation. Constructing private immutable constants or
side-effect-free factories during evaluation is permitted.

Before packing, an instrumented Node test imports every public entry point and
the complete package-owned transitive production-module closure in fresh
processes while denying or recording the affected platform seams. A production
browser-bundler fixture also builds and executes both used-export and
deliberately unused-export cases so tree shaking cannot silently remove required
behaviour. The WebVOWL production build remains a real first-party proof of the
same metadata.

If an import-purity test fails, Phase 19 fixes the source or private adapter and
reruns the complete gate. It does not omit `sideEffects`, change it to an
unreviewed exception list or preserve required import-time registration as a
compatibility shortcut. A future genuinely side-effectful public module would
require a separate architecture/API decision and exact file allowlist.

### 2.45 Decision: enforce source tooling with npm-native `devEngines`

The consumer-facing `engines.node` contract remains exactly
`^22.0.0 || ^24.0.0`. The manifest **MUST NOT** add `engines.npm`, because the
npm release-tool version is a repository/release concern rather than a
constraint on applications installing `owlapi`.

The Phase 19 manifest approval **MUST** instead provide a literal npm-native
`devEngines` object with all of these exact properties:

| Path | Required value |
| --- | --- |
| `devEngines.runtime.name` | `node` |
| `devEngines.runtime.onFail` | `error` |
| `devEngines.runtime.version` | omitted; supported majors remain governed by `engines.node` and the CI matrix |
| `devEngines.packageManager.name` | `npm` |
| `devEngines.packageManager.version` | `12.0.2` |
| `devEngines.packageManager.onFail` | `error` |

The canonical manifest does not add the separate top-level `packageManager`
field and the project does not require Corepack. npm itself is the authoritative
workflow and validates `devEngines`; adding a second package-manager bootstrap
authority would not improve the consumer or release contract.

CI and release jobs establish npm `12.0.2` before project `install`, `ci`, `run`,
`pack`, audit, stage or publish operations and fail if `npm --version` differs.
The blocking Node jobs use the exact §2.19 patches; release evidence records the
actual Node and npm versions. The versionless `devEngines.runtime` check
deliberately permits the separate non-blocking Node 26 probe to start while
`engines.node`, CI status and documentation continue to classify it as
unsupported for 0.1.0.

Every npm-distributed development tool is installed from the reviewed
`package-lock.json` by `npm ci` and invoked through a named repository
`npm run ...` script. A release gate **MUST NOT** use remote-resolving `npx`,
`npm exec --package`, a globally installed npm package, a package-manager shim
outside the selected Node toolchain or a moving registry tag. An npm script may
invoke its local `node_modules/.bin` executable through npm's normal script PATH;
it does not hard-code a platform-specific `.bin` pathname.

Changing the source/release npm patch or either blocking Node patch is a
dedicated reviewed configuration change: update the literal `devEngines` value
and/or exact workflow authority together, regenerate the lockfile with that npm
version, inspect the lockfile/packlist diff and rerun all package/release gates.
No workflow follows `latest` or silently updates the release CLI.

### 2.46 Decision: use JSPM only as the exact-pinned reference import-map tool and provider

Phase 19 **MUST** add exact `@jspm/generator@2.16.3` as a development dependency
and configure the named reference-generation npm script with:

```js
{
  defaultProvider: "jspm.io",
  env: ["production", "browser", "module"],
  integrity: true
}
```

The generator links the five entry points from the unpacked retained `owlapi`
tarball and traces their static and statically analyzable literal dynamic-import
closure. `owlapi` itself therefore remains the locally inspected candidate;
only browser-loadable third-party dependency resolutions use the provider. The
checked reference map names all five public specifiers, exact package versions,
scopes where required and integrity metadata for every provider asset that can
carry it. Generation fails on a floating version, missing public root,
unresolved lazy import, CommonJS/UMD execution leak or integrity omission.

The repository commits the small version-specific reference map and generator
configuration, not downloaded provider modules or a package-owned universal
map. The required Playwright job hydrates the exact resolved module closure,
checks every response against the generated integrity metadata and creates an
ephemeral, mechanically equivalent local mirror/map for Chromium, Firefox and
WebKit. It performs no source transformation in that mirroring step. The job
also verifies the public reference URLs before a release; provider failure is
diagnosed/retried and must reach a truthful terminal result under §2.16.1, but
the real-engine semantic suite does not depend on live CDN responses after the
verified closure has been hydrated.

The reference documentation states that `jspm.io` is a selected replaceable
example provider, not an `owlapi` production dependency, mandatory application
host or availability promise. A consumer may host an equivalent exact,
integrity-pinned ESM closure under its own CSP and cache policy. Provider module
retrieval is application-directed code loading, not package telemetry, and does
not weaken §2.42.

No `es-module-shims`, import-map polyfill, CDN client or generated provider
bundle enters the package runtime or tarball. A future change of generator or
provider requires an exact configuration/dependency review, regenerated map,
licence/security review and the complete three-engine map suite.

### 2.47 Decision: fix the SBOM and evidence-schema toolchain

The release toolchain **MUST** use exact
`@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm@6.0.1` as a development dependency to generate
`owlapi-<version>.cdx.json` from the clean installed production tree. Its
effective invocation has all of these semantics:

```text
--omit dev
--spec-version 1.6
--output-format JSON
--output-reproducible
--validate
--mc-type library
--output-file owlapi-<version>.cdx.json
```

It does not use lockfile-only mode, component flattening, shortened PURLs or
experimental gathered licence texts. The root component is exactly the packed
`owlapi@<version>` library. Runtime optional dependencies that are present in
the production installation remain represented; development-only tooling does
not.

The development-only generator and the production-only graph it describes
**MUST** occupy separate clean workspaces from the same accepted source/lockfile
identity. The **tool workspace** runs full `npm ci` and supplies the exact local
CycloneDX binary through a named npm script. The **subject workspace** runs
`npm ci --omit=dev`, contains the package plus only its locked production
installation and does not contain the generator. The script points the tool
workspace's binary at the subject package manifest/tree; it does not install the
generator into the subject, use remote `npx`, pretend a production-only install
contains a development binary or generate from the tool workspace's full
`node_modules` graph.

A separate gate compares components, versions, dependency edges and root
identity with `npm ls --omit=dev --all --json` run in the subject workspace, the
accepted lockfile and the packed production dependency inventory. Any
CycloneDX classification or traversal omission is therefore detected rather
than normalized as truth. Licence/NOTICE completeness remains a separate
reviewed gate rather than being delegated to experimental SBOM text collection.

All repository-owned machine-readable release/governance records use versioned
JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 schemas, exact `ajv@8.20.0` and exact
`ajv-formats@3.0.1` development dependencies. The named validator script uses
Ajv's Draft 2020-12 mode, registers the standard format vocabulary and treats an
unknown or ignored format as a validation/configuration failure. This permits
schemas to enforce their URI and date-time fields rather than merely checking
that those values are strings. This covers at least release evidence, amendments,
extended tests, registry operations, dependency-advisory exceptions,
code-scanning exceptions, authorized signers and history partition/mapping.
Each schema has a stable project-controlled `$id`, a project schema version,
closed record objects with `additionalProperties: false` by default and an
explicit extension object only where forward-compatible private annotations are
actually required.

Every generated/committed record identifies its schema `$id`/version and the
validator version, and validation occurs before attachment, commit or use by a
release gate. Identical logical inputs serialize deterministically, but a
publication record containing actual timestamps, identities or registry
observations is not falsely described as reproducible across different release
events. The accepted bytes and their digest are immutable instead.

The release-evidence manifest receives no redundant detached signature. Its
digest is recorded in the append-only repository release record and GitHub's
immutable release attestation covers the retained asset under §2.40. SBOM,
schema or validator tool upgrades are isolated exact dependency/configuration
changes whose output diff and release-gate compatibility are reviewed before
acceptance.

### 2.48 Decision: publish an ordinary library dependency graph, not a locked deployment tree

The six §2.32 foundational runtime packages **MUST** remain ordinary exact
direct entries in `dependencies`. The initial package **MUST NOT** contain an
`npm-shrinkwrap.json`, and its manifest **MUST NOT** contain
`bundleDependencies`/`bundledDependencies`, `peerDependencies`,
`optionalDependencies` or `overrides`. None of those mechanisms may be inferred
from the requirement to test a deterministic release graph. These dependencies
are private implementation engines rather than consumer-selected plugins,
optional capabilities or embedded package payloads.

The canonical `package-lock.json` remains committed, reviewed and authoritative
for source development, CI, release construction, the §2.47 SBOM and the locked
candidate graph. It is repository-only and absent from the npm tarball. The
release record therefore describes that exact tested graph without claiming
that a reusable library's downstream installation inherits the repository
lockfile.

Every candidate also receives a deliberately independent consumer-resolution
test. In a new directory with an empty npm cache and no pre-existing manifest,
lockfile, workspace or overrides, initialize an ordinary consumer and install
the retained tarball. After registry publication, repeat with the exact public
coordinate. Record the resulting lockfile and full production inventory, prove
that every direct dependency still has the exact manifest version, run the
installed-package semantic/browser gates, audit and signature checks, and
account for every difference from the locked release graph. A transitive
difference is not automatically a defect; an undeclared dependency, forbidden
source, incompatible resolution, failed gate or unexplained identity difference
is.

Before production completion, create the separately approved §§2.55–2.61
`maintenance.yml` weekly/manual monitor. Its `contents: read` health job installs
`owlapi@latest` into a clean lockless consumer and runs the public smoke,
production-audit and §2.51 signature gates with the exact cache-disabled Action
inventory. Only a separate reporter job receives
`issues: write` to create or update one structured maintenance finding when a
newly resolved graph fails. Neither job has npm, release or source-write
authority, and the workflow **MUST NOT** modify dependencies, source,
distribution tags or releases. A correction follows the ordinary reviewed
dependency-update and new-version process; it never mutates an existing package
coordinate.

### 2.49 Decision: independently lint the exact tarball with exact-pinned `publint`

Phase 19 **MUST** add one exact-pinned `publint` development dependency. The
present approved baseline is exactly `0.3.24`. A later version satisfies the
requested `0.3.24`-or-greater floor only when its release notes/rules and output
have been separately reviewed and the literal replacement is accepted through
the Phase 19 configuration gate. The manifest and lockfile **MUST NOT** encode
`>=0.3.24`, a caret/tilde range, `latest` or another floating selector.

After the retained tarball exists, invoke the installed binary against that
file—not the source directory and not a second pack operation—with semantics
equivalent to:

```text
publint owlapi-<version>.tgz --strict
```

Errors and warnings are release-blocking; suggestions are recorded for human
review but do not become requirements merely because the generic tool prefers a
different package style. Run the same pinned validator against the independently
downloaded registry tarball after publication and require identical relevant
findings. Release evidence records the exact validator version, command, input
digest and structured or normalized result.

`publint` is an independent ecosystem check, not the authority for this
project's deliberate API. It supplements rather than replaces the exact
export/negative-path, packlist, binding-identity, import-purity, consumer and
browser gates. If a future warning demonstrably conflicts with an intentional
contract, a release may proceed only with a §2.47-schema-valid exception naming
the exact tool version, rule, affected package versions, evidence, rationale,
reviewer and expiry. Blanket suppression, an unversioned exception, a floating
`npx` invocation or an exception to an actual error is forbidden.

### 2.50 Decision: govern third-party material according to the distribution that contains it

The canonical repository **MUST** maintain a versioned, Draft 2020-12-validated
`docs/provenance/third-party-material.json` record for the complete release
production graph, release/evidence development tools and every third-party file
deliberately copied or generated into the package. Automation may derive the
candidate inventory, but a human reviewer remains responsible for the
distribution/licence conclusion. Each record includes at least:

- exact component name/version and dependency path;
- relationship (`EXTERNAL_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCY`, `EMBEDDED_OR_COPIED`,
  `GENERATED_FROM_THIRD_PARTY`, or `DEVELOPMENT_ONLY`);
- declared SPDX expression and any independently detected qualification;
- inspected licence/notice filenames, byte digests and source/registry URLs;
- applicable copyright/attribution/notice text;
- package-tarball and deployed-application distribution scope;
- compatibility and notice disposition with rationale; and
- reviewer, review date and evidence/schema versions.

The production-scoped subset of the lockfile, §2.47 SBOM, installed production
inventory and third-party-material record must agree on components and versions;
development-only rows reconcile separately with the release toolchain and full
lockfile. Package metadata alone cannot establish the actual licence/notice files
or resolve an ambiguous expression, and the CycloneDX generator's deliberately
disabled experimental licence-text gathering does not replace this review.

The packed `NOTICE` is a mechanically checked human view of the material that
the `owlapi` tarball actually distributes, together with a clear statement that
ordinary external npm dependencies remain separately licensed. It preserves
every notice required by embedded/copied material but does not concatenate every
licence in the externally installed dependency graph. `LICENSE` remains the
complete unmodified AGPLv3 text governing package-owned material; neither file
purports to relicense dependencies.

WebVOWL's production bundle is a distinct distribution scope because its build
may physically incorporate `owlapi` and third-party dependency code. Phase 20
must independently inventory the deployed bundle, reconcile it with its own
lockfile/build manifest and preserve all applicable notices. Passing the
`owlapi` tarball notice gate is not evidence that the WebVOWL bundle's separate
review passed.

### 2.51 Decision: verify the exact npm package attestation, not a badge or aggregate count

After every registry publication, the fresh consumer **MUST** use the exact
§2.45-approved npm patch to run:

```text
npm audit signatures --json --include-attestations
```

A project-owned validator then identifies the exact root `owlapi@<version>`
coordinate and proves all of the following:

- its npm registry signature verifies against the exact registry integrity;
- the required provenance and publish attestations are present and valid;
- the attested subject digest equals the downloaded registry tarball;
- the source identity is exactly the case-sensitive public
  `Hadden-Industries/owlapi` repository;
- the workflow, Git tag, source commit, hosted build identity and public
  transparency-log evidence match the authorized release; and
- no attestation belonging only to another package/version is counted as
  `owlapi` evidence.

The bootstrap alpha explicitly requests npm provenance because it uses the
one-day, single-attempt granular access token defined by §2.53. Releases from
the trusted publisher rely on npm's
automatic provenance and do not add a duplicate attestation step or flag merely
for symmetry. A runtime dependency without its own provenance is assessed under
§§2.32 and 2.34; it does not excuse `owlapi` from its own mandatory attestation
and is not silently reported as an `owlapi` provenance failure.

The immutable release evidence retains a normalized root-package record:
coordinate, registry integrity, subject/attestation digests, certificate/source/
workflow identity, transparency-log references, validator/npm versions and the
result. The raw all-dependency DSSE response remains diagnostic evidence rather
than a fifth permanent release asset. If the approved npm patch cannot validate
the registry's current attestation format, the release blocks until the
controlled §2.45 npm-update process is completed; the workflow never switches
to `latest` during a release.

### 2.52 Decision: close immutable releases with exact checksums and per-asset verification

`SHA256SUMS` **MUST** be UTF-8 text with LF line endings, exactly one lowercase
64-hex-character SHA-256 followed by two ASCII spaces and the stable basename,
sorted bytewise by filename, for precisely:

```text
owlapi-<version>.cdx.json
owlapi-<version>.tgz
```

It contains no path, timestamp, evidence JSON entry or self-entry. These are the
two artefacts fixed before the npm registry write. The later-generated release
evidence cannot be added without changing the already reviewed checksum file;
its bytes are instead covered by the immutable GitHub release attestation and
its digest in the append-only repository release record.

The Phase 19 workflow **MUST** download GitHub CLI `2.98.0`, validate the exact
binary against the official `2.98.0` release checksum, and record its source,
version and digest. The release job may not silently inherit a different
runner-provided `gh` version. After the draft
release has received the validated evidence JSON and becomes immutable, a fresh
job with no retained release workspace must:

1. download the tarball, SBOM, `SHA256SUMS` and release-evidence JSON;
2. run `gh release verify v<version>` against the exact canonical repository;
3. run `gh release verify-asset v<version> <local-file>` separately for all four
   downloaded assets;
4. run a strict checksum verification over the tarball and SBOM and reject any
   extra/missing/unsorted/malformed checksum entry;
5. validate the evidence JSON through the exact §2.47 Ajv/schema toolchain;
6. independently verify the SSH-signed annotated tag, authorized signer,
   expected source commit and GitHub verification result; and
7. write the exact GitHub CLI/checksum/schema/tag results and attestation/asset
   identities into the append-only repository release record.

The release is not complete because the GitHub page displays an `Immutable`
badge, because one asset verifies, or because locally retained pre-release bytes
still hash correctly. Every downloaded asset and every independent binding in
the chain must pass. A failed verification preserves the immutable evidence and
enters §2.33; it is never repaired by replacing a release asset or moving its
tag.

### 2.53 Decision: bind npm's staged candidate to the retained tarball before approval

Staged publication is the mandatory steady-state registry path after the direct
`0.1.0-alpha.0` bootstrap. The release workflow **MUST** use Node and npm versions
that satisfy npm's staged-publishing floors (Node 22.14.0 or newer and npm
11.15.0 or newer) as well as the stricter exact §2.45 release-toolchain pin. It
publishes only the already-retained tarball—never a directory or a newly packed
copy—with this fully explicit shape:

```text
npm stage publish owlapi-<version>.tgz --tag <next-or-latest> --access public --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

The stage operation uses the exact case-sensitive `Hadden-Industries/owlapi`
repository/workflow/`npm-release`-environment OIDC identity, stage-only authority
and npm's automatic provenance. Traditional publication tokens are disabled;
the command omits the bootstrap-only `--provenance` flag. The workflow records
the returned stage ID and stops before promotion. Under §2.60, this non-public
stage is deliberately created while the canonical `v<version>` tag is absent;
the captured dispatch commit is already fixed and becomes the only permitted
target of the later tag.

An interactively authenticated authorized maintainer must then use the pinned
npm toolchain to run both:

```text
npm stage view <stage-id> --json
npm stage download <stage-id> --json
```

The review **MUST** verify the stage ID, package name, exact version, fixed
distribution tag, public access, captured source-commit identity and staging status.
It hashes the downloaded candidate and requires its SHA-256 to equal the
retained `owlapi-<version>.tgz` digest byte for byte. It then reruns the
coordinate/version check, exact packlist and manifest checks, strict §2.49
`publint` gate, and the applicable checksum/material/provenance checks against
the downloaded candidate. After those checks pass, the authorized human creates
the canonical signed source tag at that captured commit, approves §2.61's
waiting `Release / tag accepted` job and the same release run verifies it under
§2.60. Approval evidence binds the stage ID, coordinate, fixed npm tag, registry,
retained/staged digest, later signed source tag, source commit and authenticated
`release-manual` review to the approving identity and time.

Only after every check and the later canonical-tag verification pass may the
maintainer use interactive 2FA to run:

```text
npm stage approve <stage-id>
```

After that interactive command completes, the human approves §2.61's second
`Release / publication confirmed` job; the workflow performs only read-only
reconciliation and verification from that point.

npm's cited staged-publishing documentation does not promise a project-usable
minimum retention period for a pending stage. The workflow therefore **MUST NOT**
encode or report an assumed stage lifetime. It records every available creation/
update timestamp and status from `stage view`, re-runs `stage view` immediately
before tag creation and again immediately before interactive approval, and
requires the exact stage to remain pending with the same coordinate, immutable
tag and downloadable digest. A missing, expired, rejected or otherwise non-
pending stage enters §2.58 read-only reconciliation; it is never treated as
permission to re-stage blindly. If the canonical tag is still absent and npm
proves the version available, the unchanged-input reuse rule below applies. If
the tag already exists, any correction that changes the candidate follows
§2.60's immutable-tag/version-abandonment branch. GitHub's separate 30-day
environment-wait limit is not evidence of npm stage retention.

A metadata, tag, source or digest mismatch **MUST** run
`npm stage reject <stage-id>`, preserve the sanitized failure evidence, and
verify through fresh registry/stage state that the rejected candidate no longer
occupies the version before any restaging attempt. Restaging may reuse the same
version only when npm reports it available, every retained input is unchanged
and the canonical tag has not yet been created. If source, package metadata,
distribution tag, tarball bytes or any other release input changes before the
tag exists, create a new reviewed source candidate as the applicable release
policy requires. If such a correction becomes necessary after the canonical tag
exists, apply §2.60's immutable-tag/version-abandonment branch. Staged approval
never repairs or substitutes for a mismatched candidate.

### 2.54 Decision: freeze and isolate the release-control toolchain

Phase 19 begins from this exact release-control baseline:

| Responsibility | Exact version | Authority/installation boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| blocking Node 22 compatibility lane | `22.23.2` | literal workflow runtime; not a consumer package dependency |
| blocking Node 24 and release lane | `24.19.0` | literal workflow runtime; sole release-production Node patch |
| source/release package manager | npm `12.0.2` | literal §2.45 `devEngines` and workflow value |
| SemVer/channel policy | `semver@7.8.5` | exact development dependency |
| reference import-map generation | `@jspm/generator@2.16.3` | exact development dependency |
| CycloneDX SBOM generation | `@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm@6.0.1` | exact development dependency in the separate tool workspace |
| Draft 2020-12 schema validation | `ajv@8.20.0` | exact development dependency |
| standard schema formats | `ajv-formats@3.0.1` | exact development dependency registered with Ajv |
| independent package lint | `publint@0.3.24` | exact development dependency |
| blocking browser automation/engines | `@playwright/test@1.62.1` | exact development dependency and its matching installed browser revisions |
| standalone browser-fixture bundler | `vite@8.2.2` | exact development dependency |
| immutable GitHub-release verification | GitHub CLI `2.98.0` | external exact binary verified against its official published checksum |
| one-time history extraction | `git-filter-repo@2.47.0` | migration-only external tool with downloaded-file SHA-256 recorded |

The exact `semver` dependency is the sole parser for release-version/channel
decisions; project scripts do not approximate SemVer with string splitting or a
regular expression. The exact Playwright package supplies the Chromium,
Firefox and WebKit revisions used by the required evidence matrix, and the
browser-install/run operations are repository npm scripts over that local
installation under the three-job Ubuntu-host §2.57 policy. The exact Vite version builds
only the standalone package's bundler and dedicated-worker fixtures.

WebVOWL remains an independent real consumer. Phase 19 does not modify
WebVOWL's Vite dependency merely to synchronize it with the package fixture: the
consumer gate uses the exact Vite version in WebVOWL's separately accepted
lockfile (`8.1.5` at this decision) and records the observed version. If that
repository has already accepted another Vite version before the gate, its own
reviewed lockfile is authoritative. Exercising two genuine consumer-tool
versions is useful evidence; making both repositories share one toolchain is not
a package requirement.

GitHub CLI and `git-filter-repo` are not npm dependencies and are not inherited
from a developer workstation or GitHub runner image. Their jobs download the
exact approved release artefact into an ephemeral tool directory, calculate its
SHA-256, compare it with the authoritative published checksum when the upstream
provides one, and record the source URL/version/digest before execution. For
`git-filter-repo`, whose upstream distribution evidence may not provide a
separate signed checksum for the selected single-file artefact, the plan records
the reviewed upstream tag/commit, retrieval URL and calculated digest and then
reuses only those bytes in the disposable extraction clone. This recorded
digest is an internal reproducibility pin, not a false claim of upstream
signature verification.

Every npm tool in the table is called through a named `npm run` script and the
local lockfile installation required by §2.45. No release or evidence command
may obtain an executable through remote `npx`, `npm exec --package`, a global
development-tool install, an unpinned download or a runner-preinstalled binary.
The selected npm executable itself is the §2.45 package-manager authority and is
verified separately as exactly `12.0.2`.

An exact replacement is permitted only through a separately presented
configuration change that identifies the literal old/new value, reviews release
notes plus licence/security/runtime implications, regenerates and reviews the
lockfile, compares generated evidence and browser/bundle output, and reruns every
gate governed by that tool. A security update may accelerate that review but
never substitutes a moving tag/range or silent workflow upgrade. The approved
values above remain normative until such a replacement is explicitly accepted.

### 2.55 Decision: separate workflow trust boundaries and retain one manually dispatched late-tag release chain

The independent repository **MUST** use these four purpose-specific workflow
files:

| Workflow | Exact trigger | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | `pull_request` targeting `main`; `push` to `main` | required package, Node, browser, dependency-review and ordinary quality gates |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | manual `workflow_dispatch` accepted only at the exact release commit on protected `main` | build, qualify, perform the §§2.60–2.61 late-tag/manual-handoff boundary, publish, registry-verify and finalize one public version |
| `.github/workflows/maintenance.yml` | scheduled and manual default-branch runs | lockless `owlapi@latest` and other read-only dependency-health monitors, with separate failure reporting |
| `.github/workflows/extended-tests.yml` | scheduled and manual default-branch runs | non-blocking branded, historical and extended-environment evidence |

`ci.yml` exposes one stable, unprivileged `CI / required` aggregate and
`release.yml` exposes one stable, unprivileged pre-publication
`Release / qualified` aggregate under §2.58. Each aggregate runs after all of
its mandatory jobs, inventories them explicitly and rejects every non-success
conclusion. The protected npm job depends directly on `Release / qualified`.
Required matrix jobs use `fail-fast: false`, never opt into
`continue-on-error`, and remain honestly red when they fail.

Dependabot, secret scanning and CodeQL default setup remain GitHub-native
facilities rather than additional workflow or publication authorities. No
workflow uses `pull_request_target`. No privileged job is triggered through
`workflow_run`, checks out untrusted pull-request content or consumes a cache or
artefact produced by a different workflow. Re-running the same failed manually
dispatched release run is permitted, but its idempotency checks never republish an existing
coordinate. If the exact coordinate already exists, the run may resume only
post-publication verification/finalization after proving the registry bytes,
attestation, tag and retained digest are identical; any inconsistent or
unexplained registry state fails closed.

Each workflow declares `permissions: {}` at the top level. A job then names only
the authority it actually requires; all omitted permissions remain `none`:

| Job boundary | Maximum `GITHUB_TOKEN`/OIDC authority |
| --- | --- |
| CI, build, package, browser and semantic tests | `contents: read` |
| npm bootstrap or stage-only publication | `contents: read`, `id-token: write`; protected `npm-release` environment |
| signed-tag acceptance, post-promotion confirmation and approval-evidence collation | `contents: read`, `actions: read`; `release-manual` with `deployment: false`; no write, secret or OIDC authority |
| post-registry package/provenance verification | `contents: read` |
| draft/final immutable GitHub-release mutation | `contents: write`; no `id-token`, npm token or npm environment secret |
| final immutable-release verification | `contents: read` |
| maintenance health check and extended tests | `contents: read` |
| maintenance finding reporter | `issues: write` only |

The repository default `GITHUB_TOKEN` is read-only. The npm-publication job never
receives `contents: write`; a GitHub-release mutation job never receives npm
credentials or npm OIDC authority; and an issue-reporting job never receives
release authority. Environment secrets are unavailable until the publication
job reaches and passes the `npm-release` protection gate. That exact environment
permits only protected `main`, requires the §2.35 explicit human approval and
deliberately retains the approved self-review setting for this release programme.
The separate `release-manual` environment also permits only protected `main` and
the same approved reviewer/self-review model, but has no secret, variable, OIDC
or write authority and every reference sets `deployment: false` under §2.61.

The immutable release identity is the conjunction of the captured manual-
dispatch commit, the repository-derived package version and the later verified
canonical tag—not free-form dispatch text. At startup, `release.yml` rejects any
ref other than `refs/heads/main`, records `github.sha` and the then-current
protected-`main` head, proves they are equal, proves the canonical `v<version>`
tag is absent and derives that tag and the SemVer channel from the reviewed
manifest. A later `main` advance does not change the fixed run commit. Under
§2.60, the human creates the canonical tag only after the applicable pre-tag
gates, then acknowledges the waiting `release-manual` tag gate; the same run
then verifies that it is annotated, its SSH signature belongs
to an already admitted §2.36 signer, its target is the captured release commit,
and its tag, manifest, changelog, SemVer-derived channel and requested operation
agree. The workflow never authors, moves or deletes that tag. A second
`release-manual` gate acknowledges completed interactive npm-stage promotion
before steady-state registry verification; it does not perform or authorize the
promotion.

One repository-wide `owlapi-release` concurrency group uses
`cancel-in-progress: false` and `queue: max`: a run that may already have created
a stage, tag, draft or public registry operation is never cancelled, and up to
GitHub's documented 100 pending runs are retained instead of replacing an older
pending attempt. Queue processing order is based on when a run starts waiting,
not dispatch time, and is not guaranteed; no release run may rely on relative
queue order, and each must revalidate the current tag and registry state before
mutation. Ordinarily, a maintainer dispatches no second release while one is
outstanding.

One `release.yml` run owns the complete candidate chain. It builds the retained
tarball, SBOM and checksums; transfers those bytes only among its own jobs through
the exact §2.56 full-SHA-pinned GitHub artefact actions and input policy;
independently verifies SHA-256 after
every upload/download boundary; runs the exact Node/browser/lockless-consumer/
WebVOWL gates; performs the applicable registry operation; downloads and
verifies the public package; and only then finalizes and independently verifies
the immutable GitHub release. The same run performs every §2.60 pre-tag gate,
uses §2.61's no-runner manual gates to acknowledge and verify the separately
created canonical tag and completed staged promotion, and records the ordering
without rebuilding the candidate. The privileged release workflow does not restore
an Actions dependency/browser/build cache. A CI, maintenance, extended-test or
earlier release artefact can be evidence to inspect, but can never become the
publishable subject.

Runner allocation follows §2.57. Every artefact-producing, privileged,
browser, WebVOWL and final-verification job in `release.yml` uses explicit
`ubuntu-24.04` x64; the four required Windows/macOS jobs only qualify the
already-uploaded candidate and have read-only authority. Each job records its
actual hosted-image identity and uses the platform-explicit shell while all
nontrivial policy remains in repository-owned Node scripts.

The one-time `owlapi@0.1.0-alpha.0` direct bootstrap and every later stage-only
OIDC release use the same stable manually dispatched
`.github/workflows/release.yml` path. The
bootstrap branch is executable only for that exact absent coordinate and uses
the `npm-release` environment's one-day token plus `id-token: write` for explicit
npm provenance. Immediately after successful verification, revoke the token,
delete its environment secret and accept a reviewed workflow/configuration
change that removes the dead token-publication branch and secret reference.
Then register npm's trusted publisher against the unchanged repository,
`release.yml` path and `npm-release` environment. Every later version reaches npm
only through the remaining stage-only OIDC path under §§2.28 and 2.53.

Repository Actions settings **MUST** require a full 40-character commit SHA for
every external Action, including GitHub-authored Actions, and allow only the five
Action repositories and exact roles selected in §2.56. Each `uses:` reference
has an adjacent comment naming its reviewed human-readable upstream release tag.
Dependabot may propose replacement SHAs but cannot merge them.
Third-party reusable workflows are absent; repository-owned npm scripts express
project logic. The workflow references are the execution authority, so release
evidence derives and records their paths, blob/commit identity, run ID/attempt,
manual-dispatch ref/commit, later tag/commit, effective job permissions, environment/concurrency identity,
exact Action SHAs, artefact IDs/digests and independent checksum results rather
than maintaining a second hand-edited Action lock.

The other workflow queues are equally explicit under §2.58. CI groups by
workflow identity plus pull-request number/ref and cancels superseded runs only
for that change. Maintenance and extended testing each use their own
non-cancelling, single-pending group so a running observation finishes while
only the newest pending observation remains. Every job/step uses its exact
timeout class; only bounded idempotent reads may retry, while every external
write receives one automatic attempt followed by read-only reconciliation of an
ambiguous result.

### 2.56 Decision: freeze a five-Action allowlist and every security-relevant input

The initial repository **MUST** permit exactly these GitHub-maintained Actions.
Every `uses:` reference names the complete 40-character commit SHA shown below
and has the reviewed release tag in an adjacent comment:

| Action | Reviewed release | Required full commit SHA | Sole approved role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `actions/checkout` | `v7.0.1` | `3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1` | read the captured accepted source and later verify its signed tag |
| `actions/setup-node` | `v7.0.0` | `820762786026740c76f36085b0efc47a31fe5020` | install an exact approved Node patch |
| `actions/upload-artifact` | `v7.0.1` | `043fb46d1a93c77aae656e7c1c64a875d1fc6a0a` | retain the exact same-run candidate bundle |
| `actions/download-artifact` | `v8.0.1` | `3e5f45b2cfb9172054b4087a40e8e0b5a5461e7c` | retrieve that bundle by immutable artefact ID |
| `actions/dependency-review-action` | `v5.0.0` | `a1d282b36b6f3519aa1f3fc636f609c47dddb294` | block introduced high/critical runtime vulnerabilities |

Those tag-to-commit mappings were resolved directly from the five official Git
repositories on 24 August 2026. The repository selected-Action allowlist names
only those five repositories and the repository requires full-SHA references.
GitHub authorship does not exempt an Action from the immutable-pin rule. There is
no separate Action lockfile: each workflow reference is the authority and the
adjacent tag is a review aid.

Every `actions/checkout` use **MUST** set `persist-credentials: false`. Ordinary
CI, maintenance and extended-test jobs use `fetch-depth: 1`; the release source
job instead uses the captured `${{ github.sha }}`, `fetch-depth: 0` and
`fetch-tags: true` so it can first verify protected-`main` ancestry and later
fetch/verify the annotated tag object, signer and exact target. The npm OIDC publication job does not check out source
at all; it receives only the qualified candidate artefact. No workflow enables
`allow-unsafe-pr-checkout`.

Every `actions/setup-node` use **MUST** name literal Node `22.23.2` or
`24.19.0`, as assigned by §§2.19 and 2.54, and set:

```yaml
check-latest: false
package-manager-cache: false
```

The explicit cache setting applies to all four workflows. `setup-node@v7.0.0`
otherwise automatically enables npm caching when `devEngines.packageManager`
declares npm, as this package is required to do. No workflow supplies `cache` or
`cache-dependency-path`, and no release job restores a dependency, browser or
build cache indirectly through `setup-node`.

The steady OIDC path also omits `registry-url`, `scope` and `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`:
trusted publishing neither requires nor receives token-authentication
configuration. Solely in the temporary `DIRECT_BOOTSTRAP` branch,
`setup-node` may set `registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org/`; the protected
bootstrap secret is then exposed as `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` only to the exact publish
step. The reviewed post-bootstrap configuration change removes that input,
secret reference and dead branch together. The removed `always-auth` input is
forbidden in every path.

The Ubuntu Node 24 candidate-build job in each qualifying `ci.yml` or
`release.yml` run uploads one candidate bundle containing exactly:

```text
owlapi-<version>.tgz
owlapi-<version>.cdx.json
SHA256SUMS
```

It uses exact file paths rather than a directory or wildcard and fixes the
following upload semantics:

```yaml
name: owlapi-<version>-candidate-${{ github.run_id }}-${{ github.run_attempt }}
if-no-files-found: error
retention-days: 90
compression-level: 0
overwrite: false
include-hidden-files: false
archive: true
```

The run/attempt-qualified name prevents a rerun collision; `overwrite: false`
prevents replacement; and zero compression avoids pointlessly recompressing the
already compressed package while the ordinary archive carries all three files
together. Release evidence records the release run's returned `artifact-id` and
`artifact-digest`; the CI identity remains diagnostic and can never be promoted
into a later release workflow.

Every downstream job passes that exact same-run `artifact-id` output to
`actions/download-artifact`, writes into a new fixed candidate directory, and
sets `merge-multiple: false`, `skip-decompress: false` and
`digest-mismatch: error`. It does not set `name`, `pattern`, `github-token`,
`repository` or `run-id`; therefore it cannot broaden lookup to another
artefact, run, workflow or repository. After extraction, the job rejects any
inventory other than the three files above, verifies `SHA256SUMS` strictly and
recomputes the tarball/SBOM digests independently of the Action's own artefact-
archive digest check.

`actions/dependency-review-action` runs only for `pull_request` and has only
`contents: read`. Its exact policy inputs are:

```yaml
fail-on-severity: high
fail-on-scopes: runtime
vulnerability-check: true
license-check: false
comment-summary-in-pr: never
retry-on-snapshot-warnings: true
retry-on-snapshot-warnings-timeout: 120
warn-only: false
show-openssf-scorecard: false
show-patched-versions: false
```

It uses the job's default `github.token`, not a PAT or external-repository token.
The Action's sole gate is the §2.34 introduced-runtime-vulnerability rule.
Licence authority remains the exact-graph, inspected-file, human-reviewed §2.50
material register; OpenSSF scores are not an approved release threshold; and PR
comments do not justify `pull-requests: write`. Snapshot warnings receive the
bounded retry recommended for dependency-graph timing rather than being ignored
immediately.

No `actions/cache`, `actions/github-script`, npm-publish, GitHub-release,
Playwright-installation, SBOM, provenance or `actions/attest-*` Action is
permitted. No external reusable workflow or local composite wrapper hides
project commands. Repository-owned named npm scripts run package gates;
checksum-verified GitHub CLI performs release operations; npm trusted publishing
supplies npm provenance; and GitHub immutable releases supply release
attestation.

Dependabot may propose a new full Action SHA, but it cannot merge the change. A
replacement requires a separate reviewed configuration change that proves the
human release tag resolves to the proposed SHA; reviews upstream release and
signature status, licence/ownership, bundled runtime, minimum runner,
`action.yml` inputs/defaults/outputs, permissions, credentials, caching and
network effects; rechecks upload/download compatibility; and reruns every
affected gate. A major Action update remains separate from other tooling work.
Security urgency may reduce scheduling delay, never this review or the gates.

### 2.57 Decision: fix hosted OS families, qualify cross-platform tarball use and record image drift

Every required job **MUST** use one of these explicit generally available
standard GitHub-hosted runner labels and **MUST** verify that the observed
architecture matches the table:

| Runner label | Required architecture | Approved role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ubuntu-24.04` | `x64` | authoritative source/build/release environment; full Node matrix; required browser, WebVOWL, maintenance and ordinary extended-test host |
| `windows-2025` | `x64` | blocking installed-tarball Node portability qualification only |
| `macos-15` | `arm64` | blocking installed-tarball Node portability qualification only |

`ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, `macos-latest`, preview, `ubuntu-slim`, larger
and self-hosted runners are forbidden in the required package/release path. A
new OS-family label or architecture is a separately reviewed configuration
change. The versioned label fixes the OS family—not a specific hosted-image
build. GitHub updates those images independently, so the plan observes image
identity rather than falsely treating `runs-on` as an immutable VM digest.

`ubuntu-24.04` is the sole artefact-producing environment. The complete package
suite runs there on both Node `22.23.2` and `24.19.0`; only the latter may pack
the retained tarball, generate its SBOM/checksums, run release-side WebVOWL,
stage/publish to npm, verify the registry result, mutate/finalize the GitHub
release or execute the final immutable-release check. Windows and macOS jobs
download the already-fixed same-run §2.56 candidate by artefact ID and **MUST
NOT** rebuild, repack, normalize or publish it.

The blocking portability matrix runs that installed tarball on all four of:

```text
windows-2025 / x64 / Node 22.23.2
windows-2025 / x64 / Node 24.19.0
macos-15     / arm64 / Node 22.23.2
macos-15     / arm64 / Node 24.19.0
```

This is a focused public-boundary suite rather than a duplicate conformance
corpus. It installs with the same consumer rules, imports all five public
specifiers, constructs the manager and data factory, loads representative
OWL-native, RDF/XML, Turtle and JSON-LD documents, exercises diagnostics/errors,
proves import purity and no automatic network access, and detects path-separator,
filename-case, line-ending, encoding and architecture assumptions. Every lane is
required in `ci.yml` and against the retained candidate in `release.yml`. A
failure is a portability defect or an explicitly reviewed support-contract
decision; it cannot be relabelled as extended evidence.

In `ci.yml`, the Ubuntu Node 24 job constructs an ephemeral non-publishable
tarball/SBOM/`SHA256SUMS` candidate through the same exact §2.56 closed bundle,
ID-only download and checksum/inventory policy used by release; the portability
jobs consume those bytes. That CI artefact is diagnostic, is never accepted by
`release.yml`, and cannot cross the workflow boundary. In `release.yml`, the
equivalent jobs consume only the separately rebuilt retained candidate from the
captured protected-`main` commit in that manually dispatched release run.

The required Chromium, Firefox and WebKit checks run as three separately
reported `ubuntu-24.04` jobs. Each installs only its matching revision and Linux
system dependencies through the lockfile-owned exact Playwright CLI invoked by a
named npm script, then runs that one Playwright project with one worker. The
conceptual invocations are:

```text
npm run playwright:install -- --with-deps <chromium|firefox|webkit>
npm run test:browser -- --project=<chromium|firefox|webkit> --workers=1
```

The eventual exact script names are reviewed manifest configuration, but their
executables **MUST** resolve from the local lockfile installation—never remote
`npx`, an Action wrapper, a runner browser or a Playwright container. Browser
binaries and browser/build/dependency outputs are not cached. Linux WebKit is the
required engine-level browser contract for this ontology-processing suite;
Safari-branded, media/platform-specific and physical-device checks remain the
transparent non-blocking evidence governed by §2.16.1.

Every Ubuntu/macOS `run` step selects explicit `bash`; every Windows `run` step
selects explicit `pwsh`. Repository workflow logic beyond short orchestration
commands belongs in cross-platform `.mjs` files reached through named npm
scripts. There are no independently maintained Bash and PowerShell
implementations of the release policy. Explicit Bash is required for its
no-profile, error and pipeline-failure semantics; PowerShell Core is required on
Windows for its modern UTF-8 behavior. The portability jobs therefore exercise
the native Windows command host without moving semantic policy into YAML.

Every required job emits a machine-readable runner record containing at least:

```text
requested runs-on label
selected run-step shell
runner.os and runner.arch
GitHub ImageOS and ImageVersion values
operating-system name/version/build and kernel release
actual Node and npm versions
for browser jobs: Playwright package, project and managed browser revision
```

The job rejects a label/OS/architecture mismatch. Section 2.40 release evidence
stores these records per job, including the exact image-version/included-software
identity exposed by GitHub's setup metadata. Different image revisions during a
multi-job rollout are allowed only when each is recorded and every required gate
passes; an unexplained or unavailable identity blocks release evidence. A later
weekly image change does not by itself require a package release, but a resulting
mandatory failure blocks the candidate until diagnosed.

No required gate consumes runner-preinstalled Node, npm, browser, GitHub CLI,
package tool or release executable. Node comes from exact §2.56 setup-node; npm
and every npm tool come from §§2.45/2.54; Playwright browsers come from the local
exact Playwright install; and GitHub CLI/history-filter binaries follow §2.54's
independent download/digest policy. The hosted VM supplies only the declared OS,
shell and basic execution substrate. Containers would add another mutable image,
registry, base-OS and privilege boundary without improving this readable-source
package's artefact identity and are therefore absent from the initial release
programme.

### 2.58 Decision: make required outcomes, deadlines, queues and external mutations fail closed

The branch-protection interface is one stable GitHub-Actions check named
`CI / required`, not every matrix-generated job name. The `required` job has no
write permission, environment or release credential; runs with
`if: ${{ always() }}`; declares every mandatory CI job in its explicit `needs`
inventory; and rejects every required conclusion other than `success`, including
`failure`, `cancelled`, `skipped`, `timed_out` and a missing result. Its only
evaluation step has a five-minute timeout and the job has a ten-minute timeout.
The package-governance suite mechanically compares the mandatory-job registry,
the workflow dependency graph and the aggregate evaluator so adding, removing or
renaming a required lane cannot silently leave branch protection green.

Dependency review is applicable only to `pull_request`. Its job nevertheless
has a deterministic conclusion on both CI triggers: on a pull request, the exact
§2.56 Action must execute and succeed; on a `push` to `main`, a project-owned
applicability step emits the closed `NOT_APPLICABLE_ON_PUSH` reason and succeeds.
An unexpected skipped dependency-review job is never an accepted
not-applicable result. The `main` ruleset requires the exact `CI / required`
check produced by the GitHub Actions app and requires CodeQL separately. It does
not protect volatile matrix check names. `ci.yml` has no path filter, and the
project does not support a commit-message workflow-skip convention: if GitHub
does not create the required check, the ruleset remains unsatisfied and blocks
merge.

`release.yml` has a corresponding unprivileged `Release / qualified` job. It
runs with `if: ${{ always() }}` only after every mandatory pre-publication job,
lists each one through explicit `needs`, and rejects every conclusion other than
`success`. The protected `npm-release` publication job depends directly on this
aggregate; no environment approval or npm authority is requested before it
passes. `Release / qualified` is a small ten-minute job whose evaluation step
has a five-minute timeout. `always()` belongs on these two aggregate evaluators,
not on long-running build, test, download or publication jobs where it could
keep executing after a failed prerequisite.

Every required matrix declares `strategy.fail-fast: false`: all blocking lanes
finish and produce independently reviewable evidence. Required jobs have an
effective `continue-on-error: false`. Workflow commands and report adapters must
not use `|| true`, swallow exit status, mark a required lane allow-failure, or
convert a test failure into a neutral/success conclusion. Node 26 Current probes
and extended environments remain outside the required aggregate, but their own
workflows report real failure when a check fails; non-blocking means “not a
release prerequisite”, not “rewrite red as green”.

Workflow concurrency is literal and responsibility-specific:

| Workflow | Concurrency group | Cancellation and queue contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ci.yml` | workflow identity plus pull-request number, otherwise full ref | `cancel-in-progress: true`; superseded work for the same change is cancelled |
| `release.yml` | `owlapi-release` | `cancel-in-progress: false`; `queue: max` retains up to 100 pending runs without cancelling the active run; ordering is not relied upon |
| `maintenance.yml` | `owlapi-maintenance` | `cancel-in-progress: false`; single-pending queue lets the running check finish and retains only the newest pending run |
| `extended-tests.yml` | `owlapi-extended-tests` | `cancel-in-progress: false`; single-pending queue lets the running evidence run finish and retains only the newest pending run |

For CI, the group expression includes the workflow identity to avoid collision
with another workflow and uses the pull-request number/ref to cancel only an
older run for the same change. For release, `cancel-in-progress: false` alone is
insufficient because the default single-pending behavior may replace an older
queued release dispatch; explicit `queue: max` is therefore part of release
integrity. GitHub documents a 100-pending-run bound and processing by time of
entering the queue rather than dispatch time, with ordering not guaranteed.
Every queued run therefore retains its own fixed identity and performs fresh
preflight/reconciliation instead of assuming an earlier run's outcome.
Maintenance and extended tests intentionally coalesce pending schedules because
only the newest observation remains useful, while never cancelling a running
observation.

Every workflow job sets the exact `timeout-minutes` class below; no job relies
on GitHub's much larger default:

| Job role | Job timeout |
| --- | ---: |
| aggregate evaluator, metadata reporter or channel-policy check | 10 minutes |
| dependency review, signer/tag verification, release preflight, npm/GitHub mutation or maintenance issue reporter | 20 minutes |
| each Windows/macOS portability job | 30 minutes |
| full Ubuntu suite, candidate pack/SBOM/audit, lockless consumer, registry verification or maintenance health check | 60 minutes |
| each Playwright engine job and isolated WebVOWL job | 60 minutes |
| final immutable-release verification | 45 minutes |
| extended-environment job | 120 minutes |

The two §2.61 `release-manual` acknowledgements are environment-protection
waits, not allocated-runner jobs or substitutes for `timeout-minutes`. GitHub
does not send the job to a runner before approval and automatically fails an
environment-waiting job left unapproved for 30 days. The workflow adds no sleep,
polling loop or keepalive. Once approved and started, each gate job uses the
twenty-minute signer/tag-verification or registry-verification timeout class as
applicable. Rejection or expiry follows §2.61's read-only reconciliation path;
it never authorizes a second write or permits a changed candidate to reuse an
immutable tag.

Within those jobs, an individual network install/download step has a twenty-
minute timeout, an external mutation command has ten minutes, a test/build step
inside a sixty-minute job has forty-five minutes, and an aggregate evaluation
step has five minutes. A timeout is a failed required result; it is never
`NOT_RUN`, neutral or success. Changing any timeout, concurrency group,
cancellation flag or queue mode is a separately presented exact configuration
change before the affected release workflow is dispatched.

All npm registry/package reads use this bounded configuration, supplied
explicitly through the workflow environment or equivalent reviewed npm config
and recorded as non-secret evidence:

```text
fetch-retries=2
fetch-retry-factor=10
fetch-retry-mintimeout=10000
fetch-retry-maxtimeout=60000
fetch-timeout=300000
```

npm may apply those retries only to its idempotent read operations. A
project-owned HTTP/checksum retrieval helper permits three total attempts, a
120-second timeout per request and retry only for `GET`/`HEAD` after a transport
failure, timeout, HTTP 408, HTTP 429 or HTTP 5xx. It honors `Retry-After` only up
to sixty seconds. It never retries an ordinary HTTP 4xx, checksum/schema/
identity failure, test failure or provenance mismatch. Generic shell retry
loops are forbidden because they obscure which operation is safe to repeat.

Every external write receives exactly one automatic attempt: the bootstrap npm
publish, npm staged publish, npm staged approval, distribution-tag mutation,
deprecation, GitHub draft/release mutation, release-asset upload, maintenance
issue write and Git-ref write. When a write returns an ambiguous response, the
workflow stops and uses only read-only queries to reconcile the exact remote
coordinate/object and expected digest/state. It may resume verification without
a second write only when the remote operation is already complete and identical.
An absent, partial, conflicting or unprovable remote state fails closed. A
genuinely new write attempt requires renewed explicit authorization; a blind
second stage, approval, publish, tag mutation, asset upload or issue mutation is
forbidden.

Section 2.40 evidence records, per job/operation, the expected role and final
conclusion, applicability reason, timeout class and configured duration, matrix
fail-fast/continue policy, aggregate dependency inventory/result, concurrency
group/cancellation/queue policy, controlled-read retry configuration, every
external-mutation attempt and any reconciliation result. Publication evidence
must positively prove that no skipped, cancelled or timed-out required job
reached npm or GitHub-release mutation authority.

### 2.59 Decision: execute every external contribution as untrusted code and keep sensitive data out of its path

The public repository **MUST** set GitHub's fork-workflow approval policy to
`all_external_contributors`. Every workflow run initiated by a user who is not
an organization member, repository owner or authorized collaborator waits for a
write-authorized maintainer to inspect the proposed tree and explicitly approve
that run. A later push creates a new run and therefore a new approval boundary.
The approval means only that the tree may consume the unprivileged CI budget; it
is not review approval, contributor trust, acceptance for merge or authority for
later runs. Before approving, the maintainer inspects `.github/workflows/` and
all other executable inputs the change can alter, including package scripts,
lockfile dependencies, tests/configuration, download definitions and
repository-owned workflow helpers.

External-fork and Dependabot code executes only through `ci.yml`'s
`pull_request` event and checked-out merge commit. It never executes through
`pull_request_target`, `issue_comment`, a privileged `workflow_run` or another
trusted event that fetches/downloads the proposed code. The workflow retains
root `permissions: {}`; an applicable CI job receives at most
`contents: read`; checkout does not persist credentials; and no pull-request job
receives an Actions/repository/organization/environment secret, OIDC authority,
npm authentication, write-capable token, protected environment or mutation
permission. Dependabot receives no exception. The repository keeps “Allow
GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests” disabled. Repository and
organization variables are non-sensitive public configuration and **MUST NOT**
contain credentials or embargoed data.

The ephemeral CI candidate required by §2.57 may travel by exact artefact ID
only among unprivileged jobs in the same `ci.yml` run and attempt. It is marked
untrusted diagnostic material and cannot cross into `release.yml`, another
workflow/run, a release cache, canonical release evidence, npm, or a GitHub
release. A maintainer approval or rerun does not promote its trust. The
candidate may be installed by the same run's ephemeral Windows/macOS/browser
jobs because those jobs have the same no-secret/no-write boundary; its bytes are
never consumed by a privileged job.

Every contributor-influenced value is untrusted data. This includes pull-request
titles/bodies/labels/comments/authors, branch names and refs, commit messages and
email metadata, issue text, repository-derived matrix values, ontology/test
content, dependency/tool output, downloaded HTTP bodies/headers and filenames or
identifiers parsed from an external service. Such a value **MUST NOT** be
interpolated directly as `${{ ... }}` inside `run:`, used to select an
executable/checkout/artefact/environment/concurrency group/API mutation target,
or interpreted as shell/workflow syntax. A shell step that genuinely needs it
receives it through a step-scoped environment variable and quotes it as data;
preferably, a repository-owned Node script reads the event/data file and
validates type, length, allowed characters/enum and intended use. Privileged
names and paths derive only from already validated SemVer, commit SHA, run ID
and run attempt—not free-form contributor text.

Raw external or contributor-controlled text **MUST NOT** be written directly to
`GITHUB_ENV`, `GITHUB_OUTPUT`, `GITHUB_PATH`, `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`, workflow
annotations, artefact names or job outputs. Repository-owned helpers emit only
closed, length-bounded, schema/format-validated control values such as a
SHA-256 digest, integer artefact ID, exact SemVer, allowed enum or sanitized
relative filename; a consumer validates a security-relevant output again.
Arbitrary/multiline content remains an ordinary file handled as data. This
prevents command-file delimiter/control injection and a diagnostic becoming
release policy.

No workflow dumps a complete `github`, `env`, `secrets`, job, runner,
npm-config, OIDC-response or process-environment context. A credential-bearing
job does not enable shell/PowerShell tracing, Actions runner/step debug, or npm
authentication-level verbose diagnostics during a real external operation.
Secrets are not command-line arguments or evidence values; they are exposed
only through the exact action input or step-scoped environment that needs them.
GitHub automatic redaction is defense in depth and is not assumed to cover a
transformed value or a secret unavailable to the current job. A sensitive
runtime value not already registered as a GitHub secret is masked with
`::add-mask::` before further handling, but masking never authorizes printing or
retaining it. Public audit identifiers—coordinate, stage ID, digest, run ID,
tag and commit—remain visible because they are not credentials.

Privileged diagnosis is reproduced first in a new unprivileged job with
sanitized fixture values. A real publication job is not rerun with tracing,
broad logging, a temporary PAT or enlarged permissions. Any required logging or
authority expansion is a separately approved exact configuration change. Job
summaries, diagnostics, artefacts and evidence are schema/allowlist-limited and
checked for known credential patterns before upload; raw environment/HTTP auth,
private advisory/report/ontology material and unrestricted subprocess logs are
not retained.

A suspected log/artefact exposure is an incident even if GitHub displayed a
mask. Stop the affected workflow; revoke/rotate the credential immediately;
remove exposed logs/artefacts where the platform permits; inspect downstream
use; preserve only sanitized incident metadata; and resume only with new
credentials and fresh authorization. No release claim relies on retrospective
redaction.

Package governance **MUST** verify the trigger, permission, secret/OIDC/
environment and artefact-flow boundaries above; reject direct untrusted
expression interpolation into shell; reject arbitrary writes to workflow
command files; and keep the approved external-contributor setting, disabled
workflow-PR-approval setting and no-secret/no-write fork result in repository
configuration evidence. Section 2.40 evidence records the trust origin,
applicable fork-run approval identity/time, effective permissions/environment/
secret names without values, sanitized-output result and proof that no
fork-produced byte or output reached privileged publication authority.

### 2.60 Decision: qualify and, where possible, stage before creating the immutable canonical release tag

`release.yml` **MUST** use `workflow_dispatch`, not a tag push, as its sole
release trigger. GitHub may offer a branch/tag selector for a manual dispatch,
but the workflow accepts only `refs/heads/main`. Its first unprivileged job
records `github.ref`, `github.sha`, the then-current protected-`main` head and the
workflow blob/commit; requires the dispatch SHA to equal that captured head;
verifies that the commit has the required `CI / required` and CodeQL results;
derives the exact package version, canonical `v<version>` tag and `next`/`latest`
channel from reviewed repository files; and fails if that canonical tag or npm
coordinate already exists unexpectedly. A later advance of `main` does not
retarget the already-running release. Free-form version, tag, commit, registry,
channel or package-name dispatch inputs are forbidden.

The same serialized, cache-free run then completes every deterministic §17.26.2
gate and produces the one retained tarball, SBOM and `SHA256SUMS`. `Release /
qualified` must pass before any environment or registry authority is requested.
The workflow records that no canonical release tag exists at this point and
keeps the candidate within the exact same-run/attempt artefact-ID boundary in
§2.56. CI output, an earlier release run, a release cache or a manually rebuilt
tarball cannot replace it.

The late-tag sequence has exactly two publication modes:

| Mode | Required ordering |

| `DIRECT_BOOTSTRAP` for the still-absent `owlapi@0.1.0-alpha.0` package | fully qualify the retained candidate without npm/GitHub mutation; let the tag-acceptance job wait at `release-manual`; have the authorized human create and push the SSH-signed annotated `v0.1.0-alpha.0` tag at the captured commit and then approve that waiting job; verify the tag locally and through GitHub; create and populate the draft release; then separately approve `npm-release` and perform the one authorized direct npm write |
| `OIDC_STAGED` for every later release | after `Release / qualified`, use the protected `npm-release` environment and stage-only OIDC to stage the retained tarball while the canonical tag is still absent; have an interactively authenticated maintainer run `stage view`/`stage download`, prove byte identity and rerun the required tarball checks; only then create and push the SSH-signed annotated `v<version>` tag at the captured commit and approve the first `release-manual` job; have the same run verify it and create/populate the draft release; after interactive 2FA promotion of that exact stage, approve the second `release-manual` job so the same run performs fresh-registry verification |

The `npm-release` environment's deployment policy therefore permits only the
protected `main` branch, because the run's `GITHUB_REF` is `refs/heads/main`; it
does not pretend that a not-yet-created tag triggered the run. The environment
still requires §2.35's explicit named-human approval, and only the exact stage or
bootstrap job receives its npm authority. npm trusted-publisher identity remains
the exact repository, `release.yml` filename and `npm-release` environment.
Before any package becomes public, the workflow must additionally prove that the
later tag exists, targets the captured dispatch SHA, is annotated and SSH-signed
by an already authorized signer, is GitHub-verified, is protected against update/
deletion and agrees with the manifest, changelog, channel and staged or direct
coordinate. GitHub-release mutation cannot precede that proof. The workflow does
not create, push, move or delete the tag.

For `OIDC_STAGED`, the protected stage-creation job ends after returning the
stage ID. The first later `release-manual` job in the same run remains without
npm or GitHub-write authority and is not sent to a runner until the human has
completed staged-byte review, pushed the canonical tag and explicitly approved
that job. After it verifies the tag and a separate job creates the draft, the
human performs `npm stage approve <stage-id>` with 2FA and then approves the
second `release-manual` job. That job starts only to reconcile and verify the now-
public coordinate with bounded idempotent reads. Neither manual gate polls from
an allocated runner. If a gate is rejected or expires, the run fails without a
second mutation; a rerun may resume only after §2.58/§2.61 read-only
reconciliation proves the exact stage, tag, draft or public coordinate is
identical. It never creates a replacement stage blindly. The bootstrap path has
no pre-tag registry write because npm cannot stage a package that does not yet
exist.

Failure handling is ordered by the irreversible boundary:

1. **Before canonical-tag creation:** no release tag or public npm version is
   consumed. Reject any staged candidate when its bytes, metadata or intended
   channel are invalid; verify that npm again reports the version available;
   correct tracked inputs through a new reviewed release pull request; and
   dispatch a new run. The same intended package version may be reused only when
   registry and tag queries prove it remains unused.
2. **Ambiguous external response with unchanged inputs:** perform only §2.58's
   exact read-only reconciliation. An already-complete identical stage, tag,
   draft, asset or public package may resume at verification; an absent,
   conflicting or unprovable result requires renewed authorization before any
   new write.
3. **Deterministic correction required after the immutable canonical tag exists
   but before npm publication:** do not move, delete or recreate the tag, and do
   not publish known-defective bytes merely to satisfy the planned version.
   Reject a pending stage, preserve a sanitized append-only failed-attempt record
   at `docs/provenance/release-attempts/<version>/<run-id>-<attempt>.json`, and
   permanently abandon that package version under project policy even if npm has
   not consumed it. The next reviewed prerelease normally advances
   `0.1.0-alpha.0` to `0.1.0-alpha.1`; an abandoned production `v0.1.0` advances the
   same frozen production surface to the next available patch, normally `0.1.1`,
   which becomes the first Hadden Industries production release and WebVOWL cutover only
   after the complete release-candidate/production gate. This is the sole prepublication exception
   to the plan's normal exact-version terminal target.
4. **After npm publication:** preserve the coordinate, tag and evidence and use
   §2.33's bad-release containment/corrective-version process. The prepublication
   abandoned-tag rule cannot be invoked retroactively to erase a public release.

The failed-attempt record identifies the dispatch/run/attempt, fixed commit,
intended coordinate/channel, retained candidate and stage digests when present,
tag/signer verification, completed gates, exact failure boundary, remote-state
reconciliation, rejection result, abandonment decision and successor version;
it contains no credential or private report data and is excluded from the npm
tarball. Successful §2.40 evidence records the dispatch and initial tag-absence
state, completion of deterministic qualification, pre-tag stage identity and
byte equality where applicable, later tag creation/verification, draft creation,
public promotion and final verification as an ordered timeline. Governance tests
must fail if a canonical tag is required before candidate qualification, if a
public promotion or GitHub draft can precede tag verification, if the environment
admits a ref other than protected `main`, or if a corrected commit can reuse an
already-created canonical version tag.

### 2.61 Decision: pause human hand-offs through one no-authority `release-manual` environment

The same `release.yml` run **MUST** use one GitHub environment named exactly
`release-manual` for human continuation points that do not themselves authorize
an external write. Its repository configuration is exact:

```text
deployment branch policy: protected main only
required reviewer: MaksymShostak
prevent self-review: false
wait timer: none
environment secrets: none
environment variables: none
custom deployment protection rules: none
```

Every workflow reference uses this shape:

```yaml
environment:
  name: release-manual
  deployment: false
```

`deployment: false` prevents a human coordination checkpoint from being
misrepresented as a software deployment while retaining the environment's
required-reviewer and protected-branch rules. A waiting job is not sent to a
runner and receives no secret. The job has only `contents: read` and
`actions: read`; it has no `contents: write`, `id-token: write`, npm token,
environment secret or registry/Git-ref/GitHub-release mutation path. The
`npm-release` environment remains the sole automated npm-authority boundary and
the sole environment named in npm's trusted-publisher identity.

The workflow uses `release-manual` at exactly these sequential gates:

1. **`Release / tag accepted` — every release.** After all applicable pre-tag
   qualification has passed—and, for `OIDC_STAGED`, after the human has viewed,
   downloaded, byte-compared and revalidated the exact npm stage—the job waits
   without a runner. The authorized human creates and pushes the SSH-signed
   annotated canonical tag at the captured commit and only then approves this
   waiting job. Once started, the job downloads the same-run candidate by exact
   artefact ID, rechecks its closed inventory and hashes, fetches and verifies
   the tag locally and through GitHub, validates its signer/target/version/
   channel, reads the current run's approval history and records the approving
   GitHub identity. Only its success can unlock the separate `contents: write`
   draft-release job.
2. **`Release / publication confirmed` — `OIDC_STAGED` only.** After the verified
   tag and draft exist, this second job waits at the same environment without a
   runner. The human separately runs `npm stage approve <stage-id>` through an
   interactive npm session with 2FA and only then approves the waiting GitHub
   job. Once started, the job has read-only authority: it reconciles the exact
   coordinate/stage/digest and applies only §2.58's bounded idempotent registry
   reads before downstream provenance, consumer and immutable-release
   verification. It never performs or retries the npm promotion. The direct
   bootstrap does not use this second gate because its separately approved
   `npm-release` job performs the one direct write and can continue directly to
   read-only verification.

The release-evidence job calls GitHub's read-only
`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}/approvals` endpoint and retains
the complete sanitized review history together with the two gate job identities,
run and attempt identifiers, waiting/started/conclusion states, the authorized
reviewer registry and the stage/tag/publication timeline. For a normal staged release the workflow
graph proves two sequential `release-manual` approvals; for direct bootstrap it
proves one. Re-runs retain every review record and explain rather than erase an
extra rejected, expired or premature approval. An optional human review comment
may add context but is not parsed as release authority.

The signed annotated tag message remains an ordinary human-readable release
annotation. The workflow **MUST NOT** require bespoke stage-ID/digest trailers or
an exact approval-comment string: the fixed same-run artefact ID, candidate
digest, stage record, protected manual gate, signed tag and evidence timeline
already provide the binding, while a typographical error in ceremonial text must
not consume an otherwise valid immutable version. Repository-owned validators
check the real identifiers directly.

No release job may wait for a human by occupying a runner, sleeping, polling for
a tag/public coordinate or installing an approval Action. GitHub's environment
wait is the sole pause mechanism; after approval, ordinary bounded reads may
handle registry/GitHub propagation. If a gate is rejected, approved prematurely
or expires after GitHub's 30-day maximum, the run fails closed. When no release
input changed, read-only reconciliation may resume the same exact stage, tag,
draft or already-public coordinate after renewed approval; rejection/expiry alone
does not abandon an otherwise valid signed tag. If a corrected commit or
candidate is required after tag creation, §2.60 still requires immutable version
abandonment. If npm promotion already succeeded, recovery verifies that exact
public result and never performs a second approval write.

Governance tests **MUST** reject a missing or differently named manual
environment, a secret/variable/custom rule, a ref other than protected `main`,
`deployment: true` or omitted `deployment: false`, prevent-self-review, an
unauthorized reviewer, write/OIDC authority, an allocated-runner polling loop, a
draft before `Release / tag accepted`, public verification before
`Release / publication confirmed`, or any attempt to treat a `release-manual`
approval as npm publication authority.

    │

```

### 3.2 Problems in the current design

#### 3.2.1 `rdfParser.js` combines unrelated abstractions

The file mixes:

- RDF/XML syntax parsing;
- RDF/OWL graph interpretation;
- IRI/base handling;
- RDF collections/blank nodes;
- WebVOWL-specific subjects/maps/restrictions/cardinalities.

This prevents independent correctness testing and forces every format through the same XML-shaped seam.

#### 3.2.2 `rdfXmlSerializer.js` is a bridge shim, not domain functionality

For formats already parsed to RDF statements, serializing to RDF/XML only to reparse it adds:

- CPU and allocation overhead;
- QName/namespace synthesis complexity;
- XML escaping complexity;
- blank-node identifier constraints unrelated to RDF semantics;
- additional failure modes and tests.

All of this disappears from the core once RDF/JS is used directly.

#### 3.2.3 The parser fallback is hardcoded and mixes detection with execution

A hardcoded loop makes parser addition/modification invasive and historically allowed permissive parsers to absorb unrelated formats. Selection should be descriptor/factory-driven and separately testable.

#### 3.2.4 Existing parser outputs are inconsistent

Some parsers construct AST-like structures, some produce triples, and some synthesize RDF/XML. This prevents a clean shared semantic layer.

#### 3.2.5 Current OWL/XML conversion is incomplete and sometimes semantically wrong

The existing `convertOwlXmlToRdfXml()` implementation must be treated as **migration evidence, not as a semantic reference implementation**. It contains useful XML handling learned through real failures, but its OWL coverage is a hand-written subset and several paths either change semantics or silently omit valid OWL 2 constructs.

This conclusion was not reached merely by finding a few missing `else if` branches. The important discovery was that the current implementation is doing three jobs at once:

1. parsing the OWL/XML concrete syntax;
2. interpreting OWL structural constructs;
3. manually rendering the corresponding RDF/XML.

That makes it very easy for a construct to be _recognized syntactically_ but then be represented incorrectly, incompletely, or not at all during RDF/XML emission. The refactor must therefore **not port this control flow unchanged**. It must re-derive the supported semantics from the normative OWL 2 structural model and use the existing implementation only to recover practical parser behaviour that has already been proven useful.

The relevant standards are the W3C **OWL 2 XML Serialization** and **OWL 2 Mapping to RDF Graphs** specifications (see Core References 2 and 4). OWL/XML explicitly mirrors the structural specification, so the natural refactor is:

```text
OWL/XML DOM
    │
    ├── parse IRI / literal / individual / property-expression primitives
    ├── parseClassExpression()       ─┐
    ├── parseDataRange()              │ recursive structural parsing
    ├── parseAnnotation()             │
    └── parseAxiom()                 ─┘
                │
                ▼
         OWLDataFactory
                │
                ▼
        OWL structural objects
```

The parser must **not know how those objects are serialized as RDF/XML**. That becomes the responsibility of the single shared `OwlToRdfTranslator` described later in this document.

##### 3.2.5.1 Concrete defects and required refactor behaviour

The following gaps have already been identified directly in the current `owlXmlParser.js`. They should become explicit migration requirements and regression tests.

Compatibility mode may recover only under an explicit documented policy and must emit a diagnostic. |

This table is intentionally broader than the subset currently needed by WebVOWL. It does **not** mean every missing OWL 2 construct must be implemented in the first extraction phase. It means the refactor must know which semantic surface exists and must never confuse “not yet implemented” with “successfully parsed.”

A simple coverage state should therefore be maintained for every normative construct:

```text
SUPPORTED_AND_TESTED
EXPLICITLY_UNSUPPORTED       // parser throws/diagnoses
OUT_OF_INITIAL_SCOPE         // documented product decision; parser still throws/diagnoses
```

There must be no fourth state equivalent to **recognized and silently dropped**.

##### 3.2.5.2 How these gaps were found

The first defects were discovered by following individual code paths, but that quickly exposed a more reliable method that must be reused during the rest of the refactor.

**1. Start from the normative grammar, not from the existing switch/`if` statements.**

The W3C OWL/XML schema provides a finite manifest of structural categories such as:

```text
ClassExpression
DataRange
ObjectPropertyExpression
Individual
AnnotationValue
Axiom
```

For each category, enumerate every allowed child production. This immediately reveals missing constructs that source-led review cannot reveal because there may be no branch to search for.

**2. Build an implementation coverage matrix mechanically.**

Inventory every current dispatch case (`name === ...`, token keyword, AST node kind, handler registration) and compare it with the normative manifest. For `owlXmlParser.js`, this showed that the top-level branch set covers only part of the W3C `Axiom` group and that `renderClassExpressionRdf()` covers an even smaller subset of `ClassExpression`.

The coverage matrix should record at least:

| Construct                | Normative operand shape | Current parser recognizes? | Current output retains all operands? | Structural target           | Test fixture |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------: | -----------------------------------: | --------------------------- | ------------ |
| `ObjectHasValue`         | `OPE, Individual`       |                        yes |                               **no** | `OWLObjectHasValue`         | required     |
| `ObjectUnionOf`          | `ClassExpression{2..n}` |                     partly |                               **no** | `OWLObjectUnionOf`          | required     |
| `ObjectExactCardinality` | `n, OPE, [CE]`          |                        yes |                **no** when qualified | `OWLObjectExactCardinality` | required     |
| ...                      | ...                     |                        ... |                                  ... | ...                         | ...          |

This matrix becomes a migration artefact, not a one-off review note.

**3. Verify operand _types and cardinalities_, not just construct names.**

This is how the `ObjectHasValue` defect was found. The implementation grouped it with some/all-values restrictions because their RDF shape looks similar, but the OWL/XML schema says its second operand is an `Individual`, whereas some/all-values use a `ClassExpression`.

The same check exposed:

- optional class/data-range fillers on qualified cardinalities;
- arbitrary class expressions in domains/ranges;
- multiple data-property expressions in data some/all-values restrictions;
- n-ary sets versus ordered property chains.

A branch with the right name can still be semantically wrong if it expects the wrong child category.

**4. Trace every parsed datum through to the semantic result.**

The literal datatype bug was found by ordinary data-flow inspection: `getLiteralFromEl()` successfully creates a `datatype` value, but the emitter never uses it. Perform the same “parsed → stored → emitted/constructed” trace for:

- datatype and language;
- ontology/version/document IRIs;
- annotations and nested annotations;
- prefix/base context;
- anonymous-individual identifiers;
- cardinality fillers;
- source locations/diagnostics where retained.

Any value that is parsed and then disappears is a candidate semantic-loss defect.

**5. Audit every silent-exit path.**

Search specifically for patterns such as:

```text
return null
return ""
continue
if (value) { ... }        // with no else/error
catch { ... }             // swallowed failure
fallback default values
unknown-token recovery
```

Then ask: _Can valid source syntax reach this path?_ The union/intersection/complement gap was found because caller code deliberately admitted those node names, while the renderer had no corresponding case and ended in `return null`.

This audit is particularly important because the existing differential testing history has already shown that the most damaging parser bugs often produce **valid-looking but smaller output**, not exceptions.

**6. Use the W3C OWL→RDF mapping only as a semantic oracle for output, not as the parser's internal model.**

Where the old parser emits RDF/XML, compare the intended structural construct with the normative Mapping to RDF Graphs. This exposed, for example:

- `ObjectHasValue` mapping to the individual via `owl:hasValue`;
- qualified cardinality mapping via `owl:*QualifiedCardinality` plus `owl:onClass` / `owl:onDataRange`;
- `DisjointClasses` with more than two operands mapping through `owl:AllDisjointClasses` and an RDF list;
- axiom annotation reification rules.

The solution, however, is **not** to copy those RDF rules into each parser. The parser should construct the structural object; one shared `OwlToRdfTranslator` should implement the mapping once.

**7. Cross-check Java OWLAPI at the behavioural boundary without deriving the new implementation from OWLAPI source.**

For each fixture, execute the pinned Java OWLAPI reference version and compare the resulting structural ontology with the JavaScript result, not a textual RDF/XML serialization. Prefer generated structural snapshots, public Javadocs/API contracts, documented format identities and externally observable accept/reject/error behaviour as the compatibility evidence.

Use OWLAPI to answer behavioural questions such as:

- whether a particular input is accepted or rejected;
- the structural axiom/class-expression result produced for that input;
- compatibility/permissive behaviour not obvious from the normative syntax;
- externally observable error/recovery behaviour;
- IRI/prefix handling as observed at the API boundary;
- parser ordering/detection behaviour;
- edge cases around annotations and imports.

**Do not translate Java OWLAPI implementation algorithms, branch structure, parser handlers or source comments into new `owlapi-js` production code.** The implementation source may need to be inspected during the one-time provenance audit of legacy WebVOWL code, but it is not the design source for the replacement implementation. Where compatibility facts are not stated by a public specification, obtain them by black-box differential fixtures wherever practical and record the resulting behaviour in project-owned compatibility notes/tests.

Normative/public syntax specifications remain authoritative for language semantics. Java OWLAPI is a behavioural compatibility oracle, not a production-code template. This separation is an architectural requirement independent of the selected `AGPL-3.0-only` licence; it keeps the new implementation's provenance and licensing authority from becoming unnecessarily coupled to OWLAPI's implementation terms.

**8. Convert every discovered gap into the smallest possible fixture before refactoring it.**

Do not rely only on the 44-ontology end-to-end corpus. Add focused source fixtures such as:

```text
owlxml/object-has-value-named-individual.owl
owlxml/object-has-value-anonymous-individual.owl
owlxml/subclass-complex-left-hand-side.owl
owlxml/nested-intersection-filler.owl
owlxml/qualified-object-cardinality.owl
owlxml/qualified-data-cardinality.owl
owlxml/typed-annotation-literal.owl
owlxml/iri-valued-annotation.owl
owlxml/nary-disjoint-classes.owl
owlxml/nested-xml-base.owl
owlxml/anonymous-ontology.owl
owlxml/axiom-annotation.owl
```

Each fixture should have a Java OWLAPI structural reference snapshot and, where applicable, an RDF graph-equivalence expectation produced through the shared OWL→RDF translator.

##### 3.2.5.3 Apply the same gap-identification method to every parser refactor

The OWL/XML findings are a warning against assuming that an existing parser is complete merely because it passes the current WebVOWL corpus. The same audit must precede the migration of **Functional Syntax, Manchester Syntax, DL Syntax, KRSS/KRSS1 and KRSS2**.

There is also a higher-level audit that must happen **before** reviewing any individual parser: inventory the complete parser surface of the OWLAPI version being used as the behavioural reference. This is how the previously overlooked KRSS1 gap was found. OWLAPI 5's `OWLParser` implementation list contains both `KRSSOWLParser` and `KRSS2OWLParser`; inspecting only the WebVOWL source tree made KRSS2 look like “the KRSS parser” and hid the original KRSS dialect entirely. The extraction **MUST** therefore account for every OWLAPI parser family in the authoritative capability matrix using the exact release-status vocabulary `REQUIRED_V1`, `DEFERRED`, `UNSUPPORTED_BY_DESIGN`, or `DELEGATED`. No parser family may be absent accidentally.

For every OWL-native parser:

1. **Inventory the relevant OWLAPI parser/factory/format identities before touching code.** Record the Java class, factory, document-format factory, package/dialect and intended `owlapi-js` status. This catches missing parser families before implementation begins.
2. **Identify the authoritative grammar/reference source without using OWLAPI implementation source as the implementation specification.**
   - Functional Syntax: W3C OWL 2 Structural Specification / Functional-Style Syntax first; use OWLAPI only as a black-box compatibility oracle.
   - Manchester: use the published/documented Manchester syntax and other public syntax material first; use OWLAPI public API documentation and differential fixtures to establish OWLAPI-specific compatibility behaviour.
   - DL Syntax: use the published syntax/dialect definition where available, then characterize OWLAPI's externally observable dialect behaviour with fixtures rather than translating its parser implementation.
   - KRSS/KRSS1 and KRSS2: use the published KRSS family specifications/documentation where available and audit the two OWLAPI parser/format identities separately through public API metadata and black-box fixtures. KRSS2 explicitly supports an extended KRSS vocabulary; do **not** assume that one parser can stand in for the other merely because of substantial syntactic overlap.

   For a non-W3C syntax where OWLAPI behaviour is effectively part of the compatibility target and the public syntax specification leaves an ambiguity, encode that ambiguity as a focused differential test. The resulting test expectation is project-owned behavioural evidence; the Java implementation algorithm is not copied into the JavaScript implementation.

3. **Enumerate productions/constructs before reading the JS branch coverage.**
4. **Map each production to one structural `OWLDataFactory` constructor.** A syntax parser should not invent a syntax-specific semantic AST if an OWL structural object already exists.
5. **Compare operand category, arity, ordering and optionality.** In particular distinguish unordered OWL sets from ordered structures such as property chains.
6. **Trace literals, IRIs, annotations and anonymous individuals end-to-end.** These are cross-format semantic values and should converge on the same core constructors.
7. **Audit silent recovery/defaulting paths.** Any permissive behaviour inherited from the existing parser must have a sniff guard and explicit diagnostics, as already learned from the Manchester parser.
8. **Create a per-parser coverage matrix and focused differential fixtures before changing emission.**
9. **Retarget emission to structural objects only after the matrix is understood.** Do not simultaneously redesign the grammar and semantic model without reference tests.

For **RDF syntaxes**, the analogous audit occurs one layer later. Syntax parsing should normally be delegated to the selected **format-specific standards parser** (N3.js, `rdfxml-streaming-parser`, or Digital Bazaar `jsonld.js`); the gap analysis should target the shared **`RdfToOwlTranslator`** instead, comparing its handler/recognition coverage against the W3C RDF→OWL mapping and Java OWLAPI's `OWLRDFConsumer`. A Turtle, RDF/XML or JSON-LD adapter must not independently reimplement OWL reconstruction rules.

The parser adapter itself still requires a standards-conformance audit: pin the exact upstream suite revision, classify every upstream test under §18.13, execute every `REQUIRED` test in `owlapi-js` CI, normalize errors and RDF/JS terms at the adapter boundary, and record deliberately deferred or unsupported-by-design syntax features in the capability matrix. This lets syntax correctness and OWL reconstruction correctness fail independently and visibly.

A reusable review worksheet should therefore exist for each module:

```text
Parser/module:
Authoritative grammar/spec:
OWLAPI reference parser class/version:
OWLAPI parser factory / document-format identity:
Capability status: REQUIRED_V1 | DEFERRED | UNSUPPORTED_BY_DESIGN | DELEGATED

[ ] Complete OWLAPI parser-surface inventory entry exists
[ ] Complete construct/production inventory
[ ] Operand types checked
[ ] Operand arities/cardinalities checked
[ ] Ordered vs unordered collections checked
[ ] IRI/base/prefix semantics checked
[ ] Literal datatype/language semantics checked
[ ] Annotation + nested annotation semantics checked
[ ] Anonymous individuals checked
[ ] Unsupported constructs fail explicitly
[ ] Deferred/unsupported OWLAPI capabilities are annotated at the nearest implementation point using the source-code parity-comment standard in §14.10
[ ] Silent null/continue/catch/default paths audited
[ ] Focused Java differential fixtures added
[ ] Structural snapshot parity reached
[ ] OWL→RDF graph-equivalence test passes where applicable
[ ] Large-file / malformed-input / fail-fast regression passes
```

##### 3.2.5.4 Acceptance gate for the OWL/XML migration

The OWL/XML refactor is not complete merely when existing WebVOWL output remains green. Before the old converter can be deleted, all of the following must be true:

- `owlXmlParser` produces only structural OWL objects; it contains no RDF/XML string generation or QName synthesis.
- Every W3C OWL/XML structural construct is recorded in the coverage matrix as supported, explicitly unsupported, or deliberately deferred.
- No valid supported construct can reach a silent `null`/empty/continue path that drops semantics.
- `ObjectHasValue`, nested class expressions, inverse properties, qualified cardinalities, data restrictions/ranges, annotation values, axiom annotations and anonymous ontologies have focused regression fixtures.
- IRI resolution obeys element-scoped XML Base semantics and keeps OWL literal lexical values opaque.
- OWL `<Prefix>` declarations are semantically separate from XML namespace declarations.
- Structural output for the `REQUIRED_V1` compatibility surface is equivalent to Java OWLAPI output for focused fixtures and the real-world differential corpus, except for exact approved expected-difference rules.
- `OwlToRdfTranslator` independently maps those structural objects to a graph equivalent to the normative W3C mapping.
- Unsupported constructs fail explicitly with actionable diagnostics rather than yielding a smaller ontology.

The broader lesson is critical to the whole extraction: **do not measure parser parity by whether it produces parseable RDF/XML or by whether WebVOWL happens to render something plausible. Measure it at the OWL structural boundary, then test RDF mapping and VOWL conversion as separate downstream responsibilities.**

VOWLBuilder result → VOWL-JSON consumed by WebVOWL
```

The boundary drawn above is also a package-resolution boundary. WebVOWL reaches
the upper box only through the applicable declared `owlapi`,
`owlapi/apibinding`, `owlapi/model`, `owlapi/io`, or `owlapi/formats` entry
points. It does not reach across the box through a relative path into
`src/owlapi-js/`, and build/test aliases do not erase the boundary. This makes
every ordinary application test and Vite build a first-party consumer check of
the package's public `exports` contract. RDF/JS datasets and translators remain
inside the upper box rather than becoming a WebVOWL import surface.

After the Phase 8 production cutover, the production graph **MUST NOT** import
the legacy `ontologyConverter.js`, `jsonExporter.js`, parser, RDF/XML bridge or
serializer path. Those files remained at their existing paths for finite
characterization/reference work through Phase 17; retaining a file was not a
runtime fallback or an authorization to keep it production-reachable. Phase 18
physically deleted that retired implementation and added an executable
filesystem-absence gate.

The representations are connected, but none should impersonate another.

## 5. The OWL Structural Model

### 5.1 Why this model is the correct centre

The W3C Structural Specification does more than list syntax productions. It defines:

- the syntax-independent classes/associations of OWL 2;
- which collections are sets versus ordered lists;
- structural equivalence;
- ontology identity/import declarations;
- entities, anonymous individuals, literals;
- class expressions and data ranges;
- property expressions;
- axioms and axiom annotations;
- ontology annotations.

This gives `owlapi-js` a standards-defined domain model instead of a project-specific AST.

### 5.2 Minimal first-class object families

The initial implementation should include the object families required by existing parser coverage and VOWL, while naming/structuring them so complete OWL 2 can be added without redesign.

#### Core values

```text
IRI
OWLLiteral
OWLAnonymousIndividual
OWLAnnotation
OWLImportsDeclaration
OWLOntologyID
```

#### Entities

```text
OWLClass
OWLDatatype
OWLObjectProperty
OWLDataProperty
OWLAnnotationProperty
OWLNamedIndividual
```

#### Object property expressions

```text
OWLObjectProperty
OWLObjectInverseOf
```

#### Class expressions

At minimum the constructs already encountered by WebVOWL, then expand systematically:

```text
OWLClass
OWLObjectIntersectionOf
OWLObjectUnionOf
OWLObjectComplementOf
OWLObjectOneOf
OWLObjectSomeValuesFrom
OWLObjectAllValuesFrom
OWLObjectHasValue
OWLObjectHasSelf
OWLObjectMinCardinality
OWLObjectMaxCardinality
OWLObjectExactCardinality
OWLDataSomeValuesFrom
OWLDataAllValuesFrom
OWLDataHasValue
OWLDataMinCardinality
OWLDataMaxCardinality
OWLDataExactCardinality
```

#### Data ranges

```text
OWLDatatype
OWLDataIntersectionOf
OWLDataUnionOf
OWLDataComplementOf
OWLDataOneOf
OWLDatatypeRestriction
OWLFacetRestriction
```

#### Axioms

Implement from actual WebVOWL coverage first, but preserve the OWL 2 taxonomy:

```text
OWLDeclarationAxiom
OWLSubClassOfAxiom
OWLEquivalentClassesAxiom
OWLDisjointClassesAxiom
OWLDisjointUnionAxiom
OWLSubObjectPropertyOfAxiom
OWLSubPropertyChainOfAxiom
OWLEquivalentObjectPropertiesAxiom
OWLDisjointObjectPropertiesAxiom
OWLObjectPropertyDomainAxiom
OWLObjectPropertyRangeAxiom
OWLInverseObjectPropertiesAxiom
OWLFunctionalObjectPropertyAxiom
OWLInverseFunctionalObjectPropertyAxiom
OWLReflexiveObjectPropertyAxiom
OWLIrreflexiveObjectPropertyAxiom
OWLSymmetricObjectPropertyAxiom
OWLAsymmetricObjectPropertyAxiom
OWLTransitiveObjectPropertyAxiom
OWLSubDataPropertyOfAxiom
OWLEquivalentDataPropertiesAxiom
OWLDisjointDataPropertiesAxiom
OWLDataPropertyDomainAxiom
OWLDataPropertyRangeAxiom
OWLFunctionalDataPropertyAxiom
OWLDatatypeDefinitionAxiom
OWLHasKeyAxiom
OWLSameIndividualAxiom
OWLDifferentIndividualsAxiom
OWLClassAssertionAxiom
OWLObjectPropertyAssertionAxiom
OWLNegativeObjectPropertyAssertionAxiom
OWLDataPropertyAssertionAxiom
OWLNegativeDataPropertyAssertionAxiom
OWLAnnotationAssertionAxiom
OWLSubAnnotationPropertyOfAxiom
OWLAnnotationPropertyDomainAxiom
OWLAnnotationPropertyRangeAxiom
```

SWRL is a later scope decision unless current Java parity tests demonstrate it is required.

### 5.3 `OWLDataFactory` is essential, not decorative

Use one `OWLDataFactory` as the construction seam for structural objects:

```javascript
const cls = dataFactory.getOWLClass(IRI.create("https://example.org/Person"));
const prop = dataFactory.getOWLObjectProperty(
  IRI.create("https://example.org/hasParent"),
);
const some = dataFactory.getOWLObjectSomeValuesFrom(prop, cls);
const axiom = dataFactory.getOWLSubClassOfAxiom(child, some, annotations);
```

Benefits:

- one validation/normalization point;
- canonical ordering for set-valued operands;
- optional object interning;
- structural-key generation;
- consistent immutable instances;
- easy differential construction tests;
- parser implementations stop creating ad-hoc object shapes.

### 5.4 Immutability

OWL structural objects should be effectively immutable after construction.

Recommended implementation:

- private fields where useful;
- no mutating setters;
- copy-returning APIs for annotations/collections;
- `Object.freeze()` selectively on public records/arrays where cost is acceptable;
- ontology mutation (if supported) occurs through manager/ontology change APIs, not by mutating an axiom object.

This aligns with RDF/JS's own immutability expectations and avoids invalidating structural indexes.

### 5.5 The JavaScript structural-equality problem

This is one of the most important implementation details in the entire extraction.

JavaScript's `Set` and `Map` use object identity:

```javascript
new Set([{ x: 1 }, { x: 1 }]).size === 2;
```

OWL structural equivalence does **not** work that way. The W3C specification states that, by default, associations are unordered sets with repetitions disallowed; some explicitly ordered associations have list semantics. It also requires structural rather than object-identity comparison and recommends eliminating duplicates when parsing exchange syntaxes.

Therefore this is wrong:

```javascript
this.axioms = new Set(); // insufficient by itself for independently created equal axioms
```

Use a canonical structural identity layer, for example:

```javascript
class StructuralSet {
  #items = new Map();

  add(value) {
    this.#items.set(value.structuralKey(), value);
    return this;
  }

  has(value) {
    return this.#items.has(value.structuralKey());
  }

  values() {
    return this.#items.values();
  }
}
```

The exact implementation can be optimized later, but the semantics are mandatory.

### 5.6 Structural-key rules

A structural key should be deterministic and collision-safe at the logical equality layer. Prefer an unambiguous encoded tuple/tree representation over concatenated strings with delimiters.

Principles:

1. Include the concrete OWL object type.
2. Canonicalize **unordered set-valued** operands by child structural key.
3. Preserve order for associations that the W3C defines as ordered lists.
4. Deduplicate unordered operands where the structural specification requires set semantics.
5. Include axiom annotations in the ordinary axiom structural key.
6. Provide a separate `structuralKeyWithoutAnnotations()` / `equalsIgnoreAnnotations()` behaviour where OWLAPI exposes such semantics.
7. Keep anonymous-individual identity scoped correctly to the ontology/document/import context; do not globally intern blank-node labels across unrelated documents.

Example conceptual key:

```text
ObjectIntersectionOf[
  Class<https://example.org/A>,
  Class<https://example.org/B>
]
```

must equal the key for operands parsed as `B, A`, because operand order is not significant there.

### 5.7 Do not overuse inheritance

Java OWLAPI contains a large nominal interface hierarchy that is useful in Java. JavaScript does not need to reproduce every interface as a runtime base class.

The v1 implementation **MUST** remain native ESM JavaScript and **MUST NOT** recreate Java nominal-interface ceremony merely for type signalling.

Use:

- concrete immutable classes/objects for public OWL concepts where behaviour and identity matter;
- the canonical `kind` vocabulary for structural runtime identity;
- small shared behavioural helpers only where they represent genuine common behaviour;
- no abstract base classes that exist only to throw “not implemented”.

JSDoc **MAY** be used where it improves documentation, but it **MUST NOT** become a shadow TypeScript type system.

### 5.8 Canonical `kind` + centralized exhaustive dispatch

Every concrete `REQUIRED_V1` OWL structural object **MUST** expose a stable immutable `kind` drawn from one authoritative `OWLObjectKind` constant set.

`kind` is the sole normative runtime dispatch identity. Semantic dispatch **MUST NOT** depend on `instanceof`, constructor names, module names, minified names or Java-style visitor inheritance.

The core **MUST** provide centralized exhaustive dispatch helpers for the relevant structural categories, conceptually including:

```text
dispatchOwlObject
dispatchAxiom
dispatchClassExpression
dispatchDataRange
dispatchObjectPropertyExpression
dispatchDataPropertyExpression
dispatchAnnotationValue
dispatchIndividual
```

Each dispatcher **MUST**:

- dispatch by canonical `kind` only;
- require explicit handling for every `REQUIRED_V1` kind in its category;
- have no silent/default “ignore” branch;
- fail deterministically for an unknown/unhandled kind.

The authoritative kind taxonomy and category membership **MUST** be mechanically validated by automated tests. Adding or removing a structural kind **MUST** cause applicable exhaustive-dispatch tests to fail until each exhaustive consumer—such as `OwlToRdfTranslator` or `VOWLBuilder`—has explicitly handled the new taxonomy.

A future visitor API, if ever required, **MUST** be a façade over the same canonical `kind` taxonomy rather than a second dispatch identity.

Structural equality remains separate from `kind`; two objects with the same `kind` are not necessarily structurally equal.

## 6. RDF/JS Boundary and Quad Semantics

### 6.1 Why quads, not project-specific triples

A quad is `(subject, predicate, object, graph)`. A triple is represented by RDF/JS as a quad whose graph is `DefaultGraph`.

This means:

```text
Triple graph syntax
    → Quad(s,p,o,DefaultGraph)

Dataset syntax
    → Quad(s,p,o,namedGraph)
```

Nothing is lost when a normal triple becomes a default-graph quad. The reverse operation can be lossy when the named graph varies.

### 6.2 “More information” and graph entropy

The fourth component only adds source information when it varies. If every statement is in `DefaultGraph`, the graph component carries no additional information. If a source dataset contains named graphs, projecting quads down to triples destroys graph membership.

This is why RDF/JS quads are the correct **canonical RDF** representation even though ordinary OWL→RDF mapping produces an RDF graph.

### 6.3 Named graphs are not automatically provenance

A graph name indicates dataset membership; RDF does not require the graph-name IRI to denote the graph or prescribe provenance semantics. Applications may assign provenance meaning, but `owlapi-js` must not silently assume it.

### 6.4 Dataset formats require an explicit OWL-loading policy

OWL 2's structural↔RDF mapping is defined over an RDF **graph**, while TriG and N-Quads can represent an RDF **dataset** containing multiple graphs. `loadOntologyFromOntologyDocument()` returns one ontology, so graph policy **MUST** select exactly one logical RDF graph before RDF→OWL translation, except for the explicitly graph-losing `merge` compatibility policy.

The v1 `rdfDatasetGraphPolicy` enum is exactly:

```text
requireSingleGraph   // default
defaultGraphOnly
selectGraph
merge
```

`perGraph` is **not** part of this API. A future multi-result API may support graph-by-graph loading if required.

#### `requireSingleGraph` — default

- only the default graph contains quads → use the default graph;
- the default graph is empty and exactly one named graph contains quads → use that named graph;
- more than one non-empty graph, or a non-empty default graph plus any non-empty named graph → throw `AmbiguousRdfDatasetError`;
- empty graph names do not count toward ambiguity;
- a completely empty dataset represents an empty default graph.

#### `defaultGraphOnly`

Use only the default graph. Named-graph content is ignored for OWL interpretation, but the loss **MUST** emit a structured diagnostic.

#### `selectGraph`

An explicit RDF graph term is required through `selectedGraph`. Selecting a graph that does not exist **MUST** raise `GraphSelectionError`. The selected graph **MUST** be recorded in document context.

#### `merge`

Union all graph triples after removing the graph component and deduplicate identical triples. This is an explicit graph-context-losing compatibility policy, never the core default. Document context **MUST** record that merging occurred and a diagnostic **MUST** be emitted. WebVOWL **MAY** select it explicitly if legacy parity requires it.

RDF syntax adapters **MUST** preserve the complete `DatasetCore<Quad>` first. Graph policy is applied **after** RDF normalization and **before** `RdfToOwlTranslator`.

Blank-node identity **MUST** be preserved at dataset scope. Implementations **MUST NOT** rename blank nodes independently per graph before `merge`.

### 6.5 Source/document context

Keep non-OWL loading metadata separately:

```javascript
class OntologyDocumentContext {
  documentIRI;
  format;
  prefixes;
  jsonLdContexts;
  selectedGraph;
  diagnostics;
}
```

### 6.6 RDF 1.2 boundary policy

As of the 2026 RDF/JS data-model work, RDF terms can represent newer RDF 1.2 features. OWL 2's normative RDF mapping predates and does not assign OWL structural meaning to arbitrary RDF 1.2 extensions such as triple terms or directional language constructs beyond what OWL 2 defines.

Therefore the RDF→OWL interpreter should:

- accept RDF constructs that participate in the OWL 2 mapping;
- surface unsupported newer RDF constructs explicitly in strict mode;
- never invent OWL semantics for RDF 1.2 features absent from OWL 2;
- optionally preserve raw RDF diagnostics/context for applications that need it.

This avoids conflating “RDF/JS can represent it” with “OWL 2 defines what it means structurally.”

### 6.7 Direct RDF parser adapters, not a universal RDF dispatcher

`owlapi-js` already owns parser selection, explicit format identity, bounded detection, priority and fallback semantics. A second general RDF dispatcher underneath it would duplicate responsibility and obscure error/fallback semantics.

The v1 RDF adapter architecture **MUST** therefore be direct:

```text
                         RdfSyntaxAdapter
                               │
          ┌────────────────────┼────────────────────┐
          ▼                    ▼                    ▼
       N3.js         rdfxml-streaming-parser   jsonld.js
          │                    │                    │
          └────────────────────┼────────────────────┘
                               ▼
                    RDF/JS DatasetCore<Quad>
                               │
                               ▼
                       RdfToOwlTranslator
```

The selected v1 assignments are:

| RDF syntax  | Selected v1 implementation |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| Turtle      | N3.js                      |
| TriG        | N3.js                      |
| N-Triples   | N3.js                      |
| N-Quads     | N3.js                      |
| RDF/XML     | `rdfxml-streaming-parser`  |
| JSON-LD     | Digital Bazaar `jsonld.js` |
| N3 language | `DEFERRED`                 |

Each supported syntax retains its own `OWLDocumentFormat`, `ParserDescriptor`, detection contract, conformance manifest and capability-matrix entry even where implementation machinery is shared.

N3-specific constructs such as quoted formulae, logical implication/rules, N3-specific built-ins or other N3 semantics beyond the v1 RDF dataset contract **MUST NOT** be accepted merely because N3.js can parse them. N3-specific input **MUST NOT** be silently approximated as Turtle or ordinary RDF.

N3.js's default parser mode is a permissive superset. Every `owlapi-js`
N3.js-backed adapter **MUST** pass its exact format explicitly; a shared private
implementation **MUST NOT** weaken the separate public format identities. Phase
9 registers only Turtle. The N-Triples, N-Quads and TriG descriptors remain
unregistered and unsupported until Phases 12, 13 and 14 respectively. Syntax
overlap does not itself advertise a format: content explicitly identified as
`application/n-triples`, for example, remains unsupported before Phase 12 even
though some N-Triples documents are also valid Turtle documents.

N3.js **SHOULD** be conditionally imported inside the selected adapter's
asynchronous parse path so its dependency surface is absent from initial
application execution. Top-level `await` is not required. For inputs whose
measured parse cost can create browser long tasks, the adapter **MUST** use the
dependency's streaming surface with bounded Unicode-safe chunks, observe
backpressure, check abort/timeout/quad limits between chunks, and cooperatively
yield. Prefer `scheduler.yield()` where available and provide a `setTimeout(0)`
fallback. Thresholds and chunk sizes **MUST** be selected from recorded browser
and Node measurements rather than guessed. Production code **MUST NOT** import
an undeclared transitive dependency merely because N3.js currently carries it.

A future promotion of N3 from `DEFERRED` requires a separate capability decision specifying the exact N3 language/version, supported constructs, internal semantic representation, RDF→OWL interaction, detection rules, conformance evidence, unsupported behaviour and public API implications.

Additional constraints:

1. OWL/XML is not RDF/XML and **MUST** retain its structural parser.
2. `.owl` is only a weak filename hint and **MUST NOT** determine RDF/XML vs OWL/XML.
3. JSON-LD remote context processing **MUST** obey the core loader/security policy.
4. JSON-LD **MUST NOT** be serialized to an N-Quads string and reparsed merely to reach RDF/JS.
5. Prefix/context information is document-format metadata rather than OWL semantics.
6. Parser-specific terms, exceptions and configuration **MUST** be normalized at the adapter boundary.

`rdf-parse`, Comunica or another generalized dispatcher **MUST NOT** become a required core runtime dependency merely to duplicate syntax dispatch already owned by `OWLOntologyManager`.

### 6.8 Selected v1 dependency authority and replaceability

The v1 baseline implementations are normative selections:

| Dependency                            | Normative v1 role                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `@rdfjs/data-model`                   | canonical RDF/JS term and quad factory      |
| `@rdfjs/dataset`                      | canonical `DatasetCore` implementation      |
| `n3` / N3.js                          | Turtle, TriG, N-Triples and N-Quads parsing |
| `rdfxml-streaming-parser`             | RDF/XML parsing                             |
| `jsonld` / Digital Bazaar `jsonld.js` | JSON-LD processing                          |

These dependencies **MUST** be used for their stated v1 roles unless an approved dependency-replacement decision changes the normative plan. They are implementation dependencies rather than public semantic dependencies.

The phase introducing each dependency **MUST** pin its exact resolved version through the package manifest and lockfile. A foundational dependency upgrade **MUST** be reviewable and **MUST** rerun applicable conformance suites, adapter contract tests, differential tests, security/resource tests, browser/Node compatibility tests and relevant performance benchmarks.

Before a foundational dependency enters the release path, the repository **MUST** record:

- standards/specification versions implemented;
- pinned version;
- applicable official conformance results;
- project ownership/governance and release authority;
- maintenance/release status;
- transitive dependency surface;
- browser/runtime implications;
- security/network behaviour;
- licence/notice requirements;
- the exact replaceable `owlapi-js` adapter boundary.

Replacing a selected dependency requires an approved project decision demonstrating equivalent or stronger standards conformance, adapter-contract compatibility, security/resource behaviour, runtime support, licence/provenance acceptability, supply-chain profile and performance acceptance.

The replacement **MUST** terminate at the same canonical boundary unless a separate approved architecture decision changes that boundary.

The project **MUST NOT** reimplement a selected mature standards parser locally merely to reduce dependency count.

## 7. OWL Structural Model → RDF/JS Mapping

### 7.1 This should be one shared backend

Do not teach every syntax parser how to emit RDF. Once a structural ontology exists, there should be exactly one OWL→RDF implementation based on the normative W3C Mapping to RDF Graphs.

```text
Functional ──┐
Manchester ──┤
OWL/XML ─────┼──► OWL structural model ──► OwlToRdfTranslator ──► RDF/JS Dataset
DL/KRSS2 ────┘
```

The Java OWLAPI provides a useful secondary implementation reference: `AbstractTranslator` is documented as an abstract translator that produces an RDF graph from an `OWLOntology`, and `RDFTranslator` implements this visitor-based translation.

### 7.2 Recommended translator contract

```javascript
export class OwlToRdfTranslator {
  constructor({ dataFactory, datasetFactory }) {
    this.dataFactory = dataFactory;
    this.datasetFactory = datasetFactory;
  }

  translate(ontology, { graph = this.dataFactory.defaultGraph() } = {}) {
    const dataset = this.datasetFactory.dataset();
    // visit ontology metadata and axioms
    return dataset;
  }
}
```

The `graph` argument is a dataset-placement option, not an OWL semantic property. The normative OWL→RDF result is an RDF graph; using a non-default graph merely places that graph into an RDF dataset supplied by the application.

### 7.3 Recursive “main node” pattern

For complex expressions, each mapper should:

1. recursively map child OWL objects;
2. create any required blank node(s);
3. emit supporting RDF quads;
4. return the RDF term representing the expression's main node.

Example:

```javascript
mapObjectSomeValuesFrom(expression, graph) {
  const node = this.rdf.blankNode();
  const property = this.mapObjectPropertyExpression(expression.property, graph);
  const filler = this.mapClassExpression(expression.filler, graph);

  this.add(node, RDF.type, OWL.Restriction, graph);
  this.add(node, OWL.onProperty, property, graph);
  this.add(node, OWL.someValuesFrom, filler, graph);

  return node;
}
```

This mirrors the recursive structure of the W3C mapping and is dramatically cleaner than synthesizing nested RDF/XML.

### 7.4 Reusable RDF-list helper

Many OWL constructs map to RDF collections. Implement and heavily test one list builder:

```javascript
createRdfList(items, graph) {
  if (items.length === 0) {
    return RDF.nil;
  }

  const head = this.rdf.blankNode();
  let current = head;

  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i += 1) {
    this.add(current, RDF.first, items[i], graph);

    const next = i === items.length - 1
      ? RDF.nil
      : this.rdf.blankNode();

    this.add(current, RDF.rest, next, graph);
    current = next;
  }

  return head;
}
```

Reuse this for intersections, unions, enumerations, property chains, keys and other list-based mappings.

### 7.5 Annotated axioms require deliberate handling

Axiom annotations are structurally significant even though they do not affect OWL's logical consequences. The RDF mapping adds annotation/reification structures around the main axiom statement. This is one of the more bookkeeping-heavy parts of the translator and should have dedicated tests for:

- one annotation;
- multiple annotations;
- nested annotations;
- IRI, literal and anonymous-individual annotation values;
- equal logical axioms with different annotations remaining structurally distinct.

### 7.6 Blank-node identifiers are not semantic output

Do not test exact generated blank-node labels. Blank node IDs are serialization/implementation artifacts. Compare RDF datasets by graph isomorphism/canonicalization, not textual labels.

A deterministic blank-node allocator may still be useful in debug snapshots, but deterministic labels must never become part of the public semantic contract.

### 7.7 Why this mapping is relatively tractable

The conceptual difficulty is modest because the mapping is deterministic and recursive. The engineering cost comes from breadth and edge cases, not architectural uncertainty.

| Area                              |           Relative difficulty |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| declarations                      |                      very low |
| simple hierarchy/domain/range     |                      very low |
| property characteristics          |                      very low |
| simple restrictions               |                           low |
| Boolean class expressions         |                  low–moderate |
| RDF lists                         |       low after shared helper |
| cardinalities                     |                  low–moderate |
| datatype restrictions             |                      moderate |
| n-ary axioms                      |                      moderate |
| property chains                   |                      moderate |
| negative assertions               |                      moderate |
| annotated/nested annotated axioms |                 moderate–high |
| exact OWLAPI rendering quirks     | intentionally not a core goal |

## 8. RDF/JS → OWL Structural Model

### 8.1 This is the harder direction

A parsed RDF dataset does not directly contain `OWLSubClassOfAxiom` or `OWLObjectSomeValuesFrom` objects. The interpreter must recognize distributed RDF graph patterns and reconstruct the corresponding OWL structural objects.

For example:

```text
_:x rdf:type owl:Restriction .
_:x owl:onProperty :hasParent .
_:x owl:someValuesFrom :Person .
```

must become:

```text
ObjectSomeValuesFrom(:hasParent :Person)
```

and a separate triple such as:

```text
:Child rdfs:subClassOf _:x .
```

then yields:

```text
SubClassOf(:Child ObjectSomeValuesFrom(:hasParent :Person))
```

This requires graph-wide type information, recursive expression decoding, RDF list reconstruction, and careful triple consumption.

### 8.2 OWLAPI's `OWLRDFConsumer` is the most valuable reference design

OWLAPI describes `OWLRDFConsumer` as an interpreter for an RDF graph representing an OWL ontology. It uses triple handlers to recognize patterns, consumes some triples while streaming, and defers patterns requiring complete graph context until the graph is available.

That architecture is highly applicable to JavaScript:

```text
RDF parser-adapter quad stream
    │
    ├── cheap/direct handlers where safe
    │
    ▼
Dataset/index of remaining quads
    │
    ▼
second-pass graph interpretation
    │
    ▼
OWL structural objects
```

However, copying the Java implementation literally is not necessary. RDF/JS datasets provide powerful indexed matching that can simplify handler mechanics.

### 8.3 Recommended staged interpreter

#### Stage A — choose one RDF graph

Apply `RdfDatasetGraphPolicy` before OWL interpretation. The translator operates on one RDF graph at a time.

#### Stage B — build/query indexes

With `DatasetCore.match()` or an indexed dataset, establish efficient access patterns by:

- subject;
- predicate;
- object where useful;
- RDF type/declaration;
- blank-node adjacency;
- RDF-list heads.

Do not manually build duplicate indexes until profiling shows the dataset implementation is insufficient.

#### Stage C — establish typing/declarations

OWL RDF reconstruction often needs to distinguish classes, datatypes, object/data/annotation properties and individuals. Build typing knowledge from declarations, reserved vocabulary and OWL 2 mapping rules before resolving ambiguous expressions.

#### Stage D — decode RDF lists

One robust list decoder should:

- detect `rdf:nil`;
- require appropriate `rdf:first` / `rdf:rest` shape in strict mode;
- detect cycles;
- enforce a maximum list length;
- memoize decoded list nodes;
- preserve order where list semantics matter;
- report malformed shared/cyclic lists rather than looping.

#### Stage E — recursively reconstruct expressions

Use memoization keyed by RDF node so the same anonymous expression node is not repeatedly decoded.

```javascript
parseClassExpression(term) {
  if (this.classExpressionCache.has(termKey(term))) {
    return this.classExpressionCache.get(termKey(term));
  }

  // named class or recognized blank-node pattern
}
```

Include recursion/cycle guards.

#### Stage F — reconstruct axioms

Once expression/property nodes can be decoded, translate top-level relationship triples/patterns into axioms and add them through `OWLDataFactory`/`OWLOntology`.

#### Stage G — attach axiom annotations

Interpret `owl:annotatedSource`, `owl:annotatedProperty`, `owl:annotatedTarget` patterns and nested annotations after the corresponding base axiom is known.

#### Stage H — account for unconsumed RDF

Do not silently ignore everything left over. Provide a documented policy:

```text
strict: unsupported/unconsumed OWL-significant triples cause error
warn:   ontology returned plus structured diagnostics
ignore: explicitly requested compatibility behaviour
```

### 8.4 Complete the shared RDF→OWL contract before the first RDF cutover

Phases 1 through 4 completed the structural model and the first three
OWL-native parsers without making RDF reconstruction their prerequisite. The
remaining migration-safe route is now:

1. implement the syntax-independent RDF/JS ingestion contract, graph policy and
   baseline-complete shared RDF→OWL mapping from constructed datasets;
2. add RDF/XML as the first real RDF adapter and fix every reconstruction gap
   in the shared translator rather than in the adapter;
3. prove structural and VOWL differential acceptance through the development
   integration;
4. cut production over to the structural path with explicit unsupported-format
   errors and zero production reachability to the legacy path;
5. retain legacy files at their existing paths only for characterization and
   reference while the remaining planned migrations proceed;
6. add Turtle as the second real RDF adapter, thereby validating that the
   shared RDF seam is format-neutral; and
7. complete original KRSS/KRSS1 in Phase 17, then physically delete the legacy implementation only in Phase 18.

Phase 5 **MUST NOT** limit the translator to whichever happy-path constructs
happen to occur in a small WebVOWL corpus. Its W3C mapping inventory, Java
behavioural differential fixtures, unconsumed-triple policy, RDF-list and
blank-node safety, ontology-header/import handling, axiom annotations and
resource contracts are production prerequisites. Phase 6 supplies the first
real-adapter hardening evidence, not a place for RDF/XML-local OWL rules.

---

## 9. Parser Taxonomy and Per-Format Strategy

### 9.1 OWL-native syntaxes

These should parse directly to the structural model:

| Syntax            | Strategy                                                      | Rationale                                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Functional Syntax | custom lexer/parser → structural objects                      | closest concrete syntax to W3C structural specification; best first migration                                          |
| Manchester Syntax | existing lazy lexer/parser → structural objects               | semantic AST already natural; preserve permissive-mode lessons                                                         |
| OWL/XML           | DOM/XML parser → structural objects                           | direct XML representation of structural OWL; do not detour through RDF                                                 |
| DL Syntax         | custom parser → structural subset                             | non-RDF syntax                                                                                                         |
| KRSS / KRSS1      | strict KRSS1 adapter → shared KRSS parser core → structural subset | distinct OWLAPI parser/format identity; narrower original KRSS vocabulary and Phase 17 acceptance surface              |
| KRSS2             | KRSS-family parser → strict KRSS2 dialect → structural subset | distinct OWLAPI parser/format identity; extended KRSS vocabulary                                                       |

#### 9.1.1 KRSS1 and KRSS2: distinct compatibility surfaces, shared machinery where justified

KRSS1 and KRSS2 **MUST** remain distinct compatibility identities because Java OWLAPI exposes distinct parser and document-format surfaces and KRSS2 extends the KRSS vocabulary.

For v1, the capability matrix **MUST** classify:

```text
KRSS1 parser implementation             REQUIRED_V1 — complete in Phase 17
KRSS1 compatibility identity            REQUIRED_V1 — complete in Phase 11
KRSS1/KRSS2 grammar-gap analysis        REQUIRED_V1 — Phase 11 evidence revalidated in Phase 17
KRSS1 fixtures / negative dialect tests REQUIRED_V1 — complete in Phase 17
shared KRSS core + distinct adapters     REQUIRED_V1 — Phase 17
```

The v1 release **MUST NOT** occur until Phase 17 has completed KRSS1 parsing support. Until that gate passes, KRSS1 retains its public format identity but **MUST NOT** have an executable descriptor or appear in the advertised production-format list.

The completed Phase 11 KRSS-family work and the Phase 17 KRSS1 implementation **MUST** together:

- preserve distinct KRSS1 and KRSS2 `OWLDocumentFormat` identities;
- diff the dialects from public specifications/API evidence;
- use a shared KRSS core only for productions whose syntax and observable semantics are demonstrably common;
- keep dialect-specific parser adapters, descriptors, format identities, detection, diagnostics, fixtures and Java oracle snapshots;
- include negative KRSS1-dialect fixtures that classify KRSS2-only vocabulary as invalid KRSS1;
- preserve Phase 11 KRSS2 behavior while deepening the shared core for Phase 17; and
- implement the bounded ambiguity policy in §17.24 instead of resolving shared syntax through registration accident.

The capability promotion to `REQUIRED_V1` is an approved normative Phase 17 change. It does not retroactively make the Phase 11 checkpoint incomplete, and it does not authorize a copied KRSS2 parser, a permissive union grammar, or a relabeled converted ontology as KRSS1 evidence.

### 9.2 RDF syntaxes

Prefer mature RDF parsers rather than porting low-level syntax lexers:

| Syntax           | Strategy                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RDF/XML          | `rdfxml-streaming-parser` → RDF/JS quads → RDF→OWL                                                                               |
| Turtle           | N3.js → RDF/JS quads → RDF→OWL                                                                                                   |
| N-Triples        | N3.js → RDF/JS quads → RDF→OWL                                                                                                   |
| TriG             | N3.js → RDF/JS quads → dataset graph policy → RDF→OWL                                                                            |
| N-Quads          | N3.js → RDF/JS quads → dataset graph policy → RDF→OWL                                                                            |
| JSON-LD          | Digital Bazaar `jsonld.js` → direct RDF dataset adapter → RDF/JS quads → RDF→OWL                                                 |
| N3               | `DEFERRED` for v1; N3.js availability does not constitute language support                                                       |
| RDFa / Microdata | optional future adapters only when a concrete requirement and suitably governed/conformant implementation justify the dependency |

This strategic delegation is a major simplification: standardized RDF syntax handling is not where `owlapi-js` should differentiate itself. The **adapter boundary** is where `owlapi-js` adds value: parser selection, security policy, error normalization, RDF/JS normalization, provenance/diagnostics and independent conformance verification.

### 9.3 OWL/XML is explicitly not an RDF syntax

Format detection must distinguish:

```text
OWL/XML  → structural OWL parser
RDF/XML  → RDF parser
```

Both are XML and `.owl` filenames are used for both in practice. Detection based only on “valid XML” or extension is therefore insufficient.

### 9.4 Parser selection and fallback semantics

The governing rule is:

> **“Not my syntax” permits fallback. “My syntax but invalid/unsupported” does not.**

If the caller explicitly selects an `OWLDocumentFormat`, that selection is authoritative: only that format **MUST** be attempted and no cross-format fallback occurs.

For automatic detection, candidate ordering **MUST** use evidence in this order:

1. bounded actual content evidence;
2. HTTP/document `Content-Type`;
3. parser priority;
4. filename extension only as a weak ordering hint.

An extension or `Content-Type` **MUST NOT** override a detector's `NO_MATCH` result.

Detection results are exactly:

```text
MATCH
NO_MATCH
INDETERMINATE
```

Parse outcomes are exactly:

```text
SUCCESS
PARSER_MISMATCH
RECOGNIZED_FORMAT_FAILURE
FATAL_FAILURE
```

Only `ParserMismatchError` permits fallback. A recognized syntax error or `UnsupportedConstructError` terminates fallback. Resource-limit, security-policy, cancellation, fatal I/O and internal invariant failures terminate the entire operation.

Once a parser has recognized/committed to its syntax, a later failure **MUST NOT** be reclassified as parser mismatch.

Every candidate attempt **MUST** be transactional: a failed candidate leaves ontology state, manager registrations, imports and document context observationally unchanged. State commits only after the candidate is accepted as `SUCCESS`.

`UnparsableOntologyException` is produced only after all eligible candidates are exhausted by genuine parser mismatches. Broad catch-and-continue fallback is forbidden.

### 9.5 Immutable `ParserDescriptor` and bounded detection contract

Each supported format **MUST** have an immutable descriptor conceptually equivalent to:

```javascript
/**
 * @typedef {"MATCH"|"NO_MATCH"|"INDETERMINATE"} DetectionResult
 *
 * @typedef {object} ParserDetection
 * @property {DetectionResult} result
 * @property {string} reasonCode
 * @property {string} reason
 *
 * @typedef {object} ParserDescriptor
 * @property {string} id
 * @property {number} priority
 * @property {OWLDocumentFormat} format
 * @property {(source, config) => ParserDetection} detect
 * @property {() => OWLParser} createParser
 */
```

A bare boolean sniffer is insufficient.

Descriptor requirements:

- `id` **MUST** be stable and unique and **MUST NOT** derive from constructor/module/minified names;
- lower numeric `priority` means higher priority;
- equal priorities **MUST** break ties lexically by parser ID, never registration order;
- there is one descriptor per format identity even when the same library implements several formats;
- KRSS1 and KRSS2 remain distinct compatibility/format identities; the Phase 17 KRSS1 descriptor **MUST** be distinct from KRSS2 and **MUST NOT** be registered or advertised until its complete acceptance gate passes;
- Turtle, TriG, N-Triples and N-Quads remain distinct descriptors;
- detection **MUST** be deterministic, side-effect free, bounded, non-networked and non-mutating;
- detection **MUST NOT** perform a full parse;
- each result **MUST** include stable `reasonCode` plus human-readable `reason`;
- metadata-assisted ordering belongs in the registry rather than parser-specific ad hoc logic;
- a compatible/recovery parser **MUST NOT** be auto-attempted solely from `INDETERMINATE`;
- the registry **MUST** reject invalid or duplicate descriptors.

Candidate tracing **SHOULD** record parser ID, format, detection result/reason, eligibility and ordering reason for diagnostics/tests.

`MAX_SNIFF_BYTES = 8192` is the normative default sniff ceiling unless an approved benchmark/security-backed change updates the plan.

### 9.6 Stateless descriptors and fresh parser/session per attempt

Registered `ParserDescriptor` objects **MUST** be immutable/stateless.

Every candidate attempt **MUST** receive a fresh parser/session instance. Mutable lexer position, prefixes, diagnostics, temporary indexes and transaction state belong to that attempt and **MUST NOT** leak across loads.

```text
registered ParserDescriptor (immutable)
        ↓ createParser()
fresh parse session
        ↓
isolated parse transaction/builder
```

This is required for deterministic retry/fallback behaviour and safe concurrent parsing.

### 9.7 Preserve lazy lexing

The existing Manchester/Functional work established a critical JS-specific rule: do not eagerly tokenize large input into millions of string/token objects.

Use:

- generators or pull-based scanners;
- bounded lookahead buffers;
- fail-fast syntax detection;
- no full token arrays unless a grammar genuinely requires them and resource limits are enforced.

The previous eager Manchester implementation exhausted V8 heap when an unrelated ~2 MB file was attempted by the parser. That failure mode must remain documented and regression-tested.

### 9.8 Preserve exact lexical contracts

Known example: Manchester language tags.

Java tokenization accumulates `@en` as one token, so parser logic must use:

```javascript
if (peekToken().startsWith("@")) {
  const lang = consumeToken().slice(1);
}
```

not `peekToken() === "@"`.

Port semantic behaviour, including token boundaries, not superficial character rules.

### 9.9 Compatible recovery requires positive recognition

A parser that can recover from malformed or legacy input can otherwise “succeed” on an unrelated format. Compatible recovery therefore requires either:

- explicit caller selection of that parser's format; or
- a positive bounded `MATCH` from the parser's detector.

`INDETERMINATE` alone **MUST NOT** make a recovery-capable parser eligible for automatic execution.

This is an architectural invariant, not a Manchester-specific workaround.

---

## 10. OWLOntology, Manager and Loading Architecture

### 10.1 `OWLOntology` responsibilities

`OWLOntology` should own:

- ontology ID (ontology IRI + optional version IRI);
- direct import declarations;
- ontology annotations;
- structurally unique axioms;
- indexes derived from axioms;
- manager association if required by the public API.

It should **not** own as semantic truth:

- raw input text;
- XML DOM;
- RDF/XML serialization;
- parser-specific AST;
- RDF named graph membership;
- WebVOWL state.

### 10.2 Internal ontology indexes

Do not promise literal $O(1)$ for every semantic query in documentation. Instead construct indexes that make high-value queries efficient and profile them.

Useful initial indexes:

```text
axiom type → axioms
entity IRI/type → entity
entity → referencing axioms
class → class axioms
object property → property axioms
annotation subject → annotation assertions
signature category → entities
```

Build incrementally and avoid duplicate derived state unless measurements justify it.

### 10.3 Normative public v1 API surface

The public API **MUST** remain narrow, explicit and governed jointly by the
authoritative capability matrix and Public API Surface Registry. A binding is
public only when the capability matrix permits the capability and the registry
approves its exact Java-package mapping, npm subpath, export name and canonical
source module for the release.

The exact public package entry points for the production 0.1.x cutover are:

```text
owlapi
owlapi/apibinding
owlapi/model
owlapi/io
owlapi/formats
```

`owlapi` is the curated convenience facade. `owlapi/apibinding` owns
`OWLManager`; `owlapi/model` owns the structural model, ontology, manager, data
factory, loader configuration and base document-format concepts; `owlapi/io`
owns document sources and I/O/parser diagnostics; and `owlapi/formats` owns the
supported concrete format identities. Except for the deliberately curated bare
aggregate, each subpath is the exact suffix of its approved
`org.semanticweb.owlapi` package. Its matching source namespace owns the sole
canonical definition of each public binding; private implementation engines do
not acquire public placement by residing nearby and are not copied into a
mirrored Java-shaped `internal/` tree.

`OWLManager` exposes:

```javascript
createOWLOntologyManager(options?)
```

`OWLOntologyManager` v1 exposes:

```javascript
getOWLDataFactory();
createOntology(ontologyID?);
await loadOntologyFromOntologyDocument(source, configuration?);
getOntology(ontologyID); // OWLOntology | undefined
```

Broad lifecycle/listener parity with Java OWLAPI is **NOT REQUIRED** unless the capability matrix promotes it.

`OWLDataFactory` is the canonical construction API for every `REQUIRED_V1` structural object. Java overloads **MUST NOT** be replicated mechanically; JavaScript-native signatures are preferred. Parsers, translators and tests **SHOULD** construct canonical structural objects through the factory unless an explicitly equivalent internal path is justified.

`OWLOntology` v1 exposes direct-ontology queries:

```javascript
ontology.getOntologyID();
ontology.getAxioms();
ontology.getAxiomsByType(type);
ontology.getClassesInSignature();
ontology.getObjectPropertiesInSignature();
ontology.getDataPropertiesInSignature();
ontology.getAnnotationPropertiesInSignature();
ontology.getIndividualsInSignature();
ontology.getDatatypesInSignature();
ontology.getImportsDeclarations();
ontology.getAnnotations();
ontology.getReferencingAxioms(entity);
```

These methods operate on the **direct ontology only** in v1; they **MUST NOT** silently include the imports closure.

Set-valued APIs **MUST** expose read-only set semantics and **MUST NOT** expose mutable internal collections. They provide no ordering contract. Presentation/snapshot code sorts explicitly where deterministic order is required.

Structural objects are immutable. Structural equality is **not** JavaScript `===` identity.

`StringDocumentSource(text, { documentIRI?, contentType?, fileName? })` is public with getters for those values. Metadata remains a hint and does not override an explicitly selected format or positive/negative content detection.

Concrete parser implementations **SHOULD NOT** be root-package API. They may become an advanced public surface only when the capability matrix explicitly requires it.

`RdfToOwlTranslator`, `OwlToRdfTranslator`, RDF/JS factory wiring and graph
selection are internal. Public RDF-syntax ingestion occurs through the manager,
document source, loader-configuration and format APIs. A future storer may use
`OwlToRdfTranslator` internally, but that does not make the translator a public
entry point. Any later direct RDF/JS dataset API requires a separately approved
consumer contract; it is not reserved through a nominal `owlapi/rdf` export.

The public API **MUST NOT** be enlarged merely for implementation convenience.
Every binding is explicitly named by its public facade and classified under
§2.10.4; unrestricted public-barrel `export *` chains are forbidden.

### 10.4 `OWLOntologyManager` responsibilities

The manager **MUST** coordinate the responsibilities required by the normative v1 API:

- ontology creation and registration;
- ontology ↔ document context/IRI mapping;
- parser registry/factory selection;
- immutable loader configuration;
- `OWLDataFactory` access;
- import declarations and import loading;
- IRI mappers/document resolvers;
- duplicate ontology-ID/state validation;
- typed load diagnostics/errors.

Additional Java OWLAPI lifecycle/listener APIs are outside v1 unless explicitly classified in the capability matrix.

### 10.5 Generic import resolution belongs in `owlapi`; WebVOWL policy does not

The earlier plan put import resolution entirely outside the core. That is too coarse. OWL ontology loading inherently includes `owl:imports`; OWLAPI parsers are expected to request import loading through the manager.

The correct split is:

```text
owlapi
  defines generic import/document loading protocol
  handles import closure and cycles
  accepts IRI mappers/resolvers

WebVOWL
  supplies application-specific catalog/path resolver
  supplies permitted network policy
  supplies bundled ontology mappings
```

Example interfaces:

```javascript
class OntologyDocumentLoader {
  async load(documentIRI, { signal, config }) {
    // injected implementation
  }
}

class OWLOntologyIRIMapper {
  getDocumentIRI(ontologyIRI) {
    // return mapped IRI or null
  }
}
```

### 10.6 Imports closure and cycles

Track ontology/document load state explicitly:

```text
UNSEEN → LOADING → LOADED
             │
             └── cycle encountered: reuse in-progress identity / do not recurse forever
```

Tests must include:

- direct imports;
- transitive imports;
- duplicate imports;
- cyclic imports;
- missing imports under `throw` and `diagnostic` strategies;
- two ontology IRIs mapping to the same document;
- ontology/document IRI mismatch.

### 10.7 Loader configuration is immutable

Loader configuration **MUST** be immutable/copying. A configuration used by an asynchronous ontology/import load **MUST NOT** change meaning midway through the operation.

The normative defaults are:

```javascript
{
  parsingMode: "strict",
  loadAnnotationAxioms: true,
  remoteImports: false,
  remoteJsonLdContexts: false,
  missingImportHandling: "throw",
  rdfDatasetGraphPolicy: "requireSingleGraph",
  maxRedirects: 0,
  maxRetries: 0,
  collectWarnings: true,
  sourceLocations: true,
}
```

Phase 0 **MUST** establish finite numeric resource defaults from the resource-budget process in §§19–20. Individual parser teams **MUST NOT** select independent safety ceilings.

A JavaScript-style copying API is appropriate, for example:

```javascript
const config = OWLOntologyLoaderConfiguration.defaults()
  .withParsingMode("strict")
  .withMissingImportHandling("throw")
  .withRemoteImports(false);
```

### 10.8 Normative configuration names and loader/security semantics

The canonical configuration properties are:

```javascript
{
  parsingMode: "strict" | "compatible",
  format,
  loadAnnotationAxioms,
  remoteImports,
  remoteJsonLdContexts,
  missingImportHandling: "throw" | "diagnostic",
  rdfDatasetGraphPolicy:
    "requireSingleGraph" |
    "defaultGraphOnly" |
    "selectGraph" |
    "merge",
  selectedGraph,
  collectWarnings,
  sourceLocations,
  // finite resource/network limits
}
```

`rdfDatasetGraphPolicy`, `relaxed`, `silent` and `ignore` are not alternate public spellings.

Format-specific processor settings belong to the immutable
`OWLDocumentFormat`, not to consumer-specific loader flags. In particular, the
JSON-LD format exposes `processingMode`, `expandContext`, and `rdfDirection`
through the copying parameter API in §11.2. WebVOWL may use only their defaults,
but one consumer's UI **MUST NOT** narrow the reusable library's governed
capability surface.

`missingImportHandling: "diagnostic"` means continue while emitting a mandatory structured diagnostic; it does not mean silent omission.

Core loading has **no ambient network access by default**. `remoteImports` and `remoteJsonLdContexts` default to `false`. Local/injected IRI mapping may resolve resources, but unresolved imports default to `MissingImportError` through `missingImportHandling: "throw"`.

Remote loading, when explicitly enabled, **MUST** use an injected/controlled loader with:

- explicit scheme policy and standards URL parsing;
- credential restrictions;
- redirect revalidation;
- finite byte/time/redirect limits;
- `AbortSignal` support;
- no retries unless explicitly enabled;
- SSRF protection including loopback, private, link-local and metadata-service address classes.

The core **MUST NOT** automatically dereference arbitrary `file:`, `ftp:`, `gopher:`, `data:`, `javascript:`, `smb:` or equivalent schemes. XML external entities **MUST NOT** be fetched.

The security defaults are the same in browser and Node.js. The implementation **MUST NOT** infer network permission merely because `fetch`, CORS or another runtime capability exists.

### 10.9 `AbortSignal`

Long parsing/import work should accept `AbortSignal` where asynchronous work or large streaming inputs make cancellation meaningful. This is the standard JS cancellation primitive and is preferable to a custom cancellation API.

---

## 11. Document Sources, Formats and Errors

### 11.1 Document source abstraction

The source object should carry the concrete document plus trusted/optional hints:

```javascript
new StringDocumentSource(text, {
  documentIRI,
  contentType,
  fileName,
});
```

Unlike Java's `Reader`-centric API, JavaScript does not benefit from pretending a string is a Java `Reader`. Expose JavaScript-native access while retaining familiar class naming.

Potential minimal contract:

```javascript
source.getText();
source.getDocumentIRI();
source.getContentType();
source.getFileName();
```

Streaming sources can be added later without breaking callers if parsing internals consume a normalized source protocol.

### 11.2 `OWLDocumentFormat`

Format metadata should describe syntax-level details such as:

- key/name;
- media type(s);
- common extensions;
- prefix capability;
- whether it is RDF-based;
- whether it can contain an RDF dataset rather than only a graph.

Prefix maps belong to format/document metadata rather than `OWLOntology` semantics.

Java OWLAPI carries supported parser settings on `OWLDocumentFormat`. The
JavaScript contract preserves that compatibility seam without mutable Java-style
state:

```javascript
const jsonLdFormat = OWLDocumentFormats.JSON_LD.withParameter(
  "processingMode",
  "json-ld-1.0",
)
  .withParameter("expandContext", { ex: "https://example.com/vocab#" })
  .withParameter("rdfDirection", "i18n-datatype");

jsonLdFormat.getParameter("processingMode", "json-ld-1.1");
```

`withParameter(name, value)` **MUST** return a new format, defensively snapshot
JSON-compatible parameter data, and leave both the original format and caller
objects unchanged. `getParameter(name, defaultValue)` returns the stored
snapshot or the supplied default. This prevents an asynchronous ontology load
from changing meaning after it starts.

### 11.3 Canonical public error taxonomy

The v1 public hierarchy is:

```text
Error
└── OWLAPIError
    ├── OWLParserError
    │   ├── ParserMismatchError
    │   ├── OWLSyntaxError
    │   └── UnsupportedConstructError
    ├── ResourceLimitError
    ├── SecurityPolicyError
    ├── DocumentLoadError
    │   ├── MissingImportError
    │   └── UnloadableImportError
    ├── OWLOntologyCreationError
    │   ├── AmbiguousRdfDatasetError
    │   └── GraphSelectionError
    └── OWLOntologyStateError

AggregateError
└── UnparsableOntologyException
```

`UnparsableOntologyException` extends `AggregateError`, not `OWLAPIError`.

Stable public codes are:

```text
PARSER_MISMATCH
OWL_SYNTAX_ERROR
UNSUPPORTED_CONSTRUCT
RESOURCE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED
SECURITY_POLICY_VIOLATION
DOCUMENT_LOAD_FAILED
MISSING_IMPORT
UNLOADABLE_IMPORT
ONTOLOGY_CREATION_FAILED
AMBIGUOUS_RDF_DATASET
RDF_GRAPH_SELECTION_FAILED
ONTOLOGY_STATE_INVALID
UNPARSABLE_ONTOLOGY
```

Public callers **MUST NOT** need to parse error-message text. Errors **SHOULD** expose `name`, `code`, `message`, `cause`, and parser/document/source-location fields when actually known. Unknown line/column/offset values **MUST NOT** be represented by invented sentinel locations such as `-1` or `0`.

Third-party operational errors **MUST** be normalized at the adapter boundary and retained as `cause` where appropriate. Programming defects/internal invariant failures **MUST NOT** be disguised as parser mismatch or document-format errors.

Only `ParserMismatchError` permits cross-format fallback.

### 11.4 `UnparsableOntologyException` aggregation semantics

`UnparsableOntologyException` is produced only when automatic selection exhausts all eligible candidates through genuine `ParserMismatchError` outcomes.

A recognized syntax error, unsupported construct, resource-limit failure, security rejection, cancellation, fatal document-load error or internal invariant failure **MUST** terminate the operation rather than being swallowed into parser fallback.

This deliberately prevents broad fallback `try/catch` from hiding real implementation or security failures.

### 11.5 Structured diagnostics

Diagnostics are distinct from thrown errors and **MUST** be structured data rather than console logging.

A diagnostic should carry the fields that are actually known, conceptually:

```javascript
{
  severity: "warning",
  parserId: "manchester",
  code: "UNSUPPORTED_CONSTRUCT",
  message: "...",
  line: 42,
  column: 17,
  offset: 912,
  construct: "...",
  documentIRI: "...",
}
```

Unknown source-location fields **MUST** be omitted rather than represented by invented sentinel values.

Any successful `compatible` recovery that changes, omits or approximates semantics **MUST** emit its required diagnostic. `missingImportHandling: "diagnostic"`, `defaultGraphOnly`, and graph-losing `merge` likewise emit mandatory diagnostics as defined by their contracts.

Diagnostics **MUST NOT** substitute for an exception where the error taxonomy requires the operation to fail.

---

## 12. Parser Registry and Detection

### 12.1 Preserve OWLAPI priority as compatibility metadata, not blind truth

Existing parser priority ordering is useful for parity and fallback behaviour, but positive detection should prevent unrelated permissive parsers from being invoked unnecessarily.

Current relevant ordering derived from OWLAPI work includes approximately:

| Priority | Parser / format         | `owlapi-js` strategy                                                                                              |
| -------: | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|        0 | RDF/XML                 | RDF/JS parser adapter                                                                                             |
|        1 | OWL/XML                 | structural parser                                                                                                 |
|        2 | Functional              | structural parser                                                                                                 |
|        3 | Rio Turtle              | covered through the N3.js RDF adapter rather than a duplicate parser                                              |
|        4 | Manchester              | structural parser with strict sniff gate                                                                          |
|     7–12 | various Rio RDF formats | map each supported syntax to the direct format-specific RDF adapter; do not introduce a generic nested dispatcher |
|       12 | TurtleOntologyParser    | no need to duplicate if the N3.js adapter provides equivalent semantics                                           |
|       15 | DL Syntax               | structural parser                                                                                                 |
|       16 | KRSS2                   | structural parser                                                                                                 |

Do not clone every Java parser factory when multiple Java factories exist primarily because of Java RDF library integrations that JavaScript can replace with one interoperable RDF/JS adapter.

### 12.2 Detection API

`registry.resolveCandidates(source, config)` **MUST** operate over immutable `ParserDescriptor` records and return deterministic candidate metadata. Each parser detection result is one of:

```text
MATCH
NO_MATCH
INDETERMINATE
```

with a stable `reasonCode` and human-readable `reason`.

`MATCH` means bounded evidence positively identifies the syntax strongly enough to make the parser eligible.

`NO_MATCH` means bounded evidence rules the syntax out; weaker metadata such as extension **MUST NOT** override it.

`INDETERMINATE` means bounded inspection cannot decide. It is not a positive match and does not make a compatible/recovery parser automatically eligible.

The registry—not individual parser detectors—combines content evidence with Content-Type, parser priority and weak filename hints.

### 12.3 Sniff budget

`MAX_SNIFF_BYTES = 8192` is the normative default ceiling unless an approved benchmark/security-backed change updates it.

Detection **MUST**:

- inspect only the bounded source prefix;
- remain deterministic and side-effect free;
- perform no network I/O;
- perform no ontology/manager mutation;
- avoid full-document parsing/tokenization;
- avoid catastrophic regular expressions;
- decode only the required byte prefix.

An explicitly selected format bypasses cross-format detection and fallback; it does not weaken syntax validation inside the selected parser.

### 12.4 XML detection

The XML branch must distinguish:

1. malformed/non-XML;
2. well-formed OWL/XML;
3. well-formed RDF/XML;
4. generic XML that is neither supported syntax.

Do not treat “well formed” as “RDF/XML.”

### 12.5 DOM parser semantic differences

Browser `DOMParser` and `@xmldom/xmldom` have historically differed in how they surface parse failures. Wrap XML parsing behind one adapter that normalizes:

```javascript
parseXml(text) → Document | throws XmlParseError
```

so parser code never depends on whether an environment returns `<parsererror>` or throws.

---

## 13. Logical Architecture, Physical Structure and JavaScript Engineering Quality

The architecture defines normative **logical boundaries and dependency rules** while generally allowing implementation teams to choose the most appropriate physical JavaScript module/directory structure.

This freedom is conditional: every implementation choice **MUST** follow current modern JavaScript engineering best practices, repository engineering standards and all normative constraints in this blueprint. Passing tests does not waive engineering quality.

The implementation **MUST** preserve clear logical boundaries between at least:

```text
OWL structural model
OWLDataFactory / structural construction
parser framework and registry
OWL-native syntax parsers
RDF syntax adapters
canonical RDF/JS representation
RDF→OWL translation
OWL→RDF translation
ontology manager and document loading
document/source context
diagnostics and public errors
WebVOWL/VOWLBuilder integration
```

Third-party parser APIs **MUST NOT** leak through canonical model, translator, manager or public-package boundaries. WebVOWL-specific behaviour **MUST NOT** leak into generic `owlapi-js` core.

Registered public namespace paths and canonical public binding ownership are
normative under §2.10.4. Within those namespaces, exact filenames and
class-to-file ratios remain non-normative unless the registry names a canonical
source module. Private `internal/` nesting is responsibility-oriented and may be
refactored without changing the public contract. The team **MUST** maximize
cohesion, minimize unnecessary coupling, make navigation/testing clear and avoid
gratuitously mirroring Java OWLAPI implementation packages or legacy WebVOWL
layout beneath `internal/`.

Production code **MUST** use modern standards-based ECMAScript and native ESM appropriate to the supported browser/Node baseline. New CommonJS/AMD/UMD-style internals, namespace-as-module substitutes, unnecessary transpilation or compilation machinery **MUST NOT** be introduced.

Modules **MUST** have clear responsibilities and small intentional interfaces. Circular dependencies **SHOULD** be designed out. Public barrels **MAY** define supported entry points; internal code **SHOULD** prefer direct imports when that avoids cycles/hidden dependencies. Importing a module **MUST NOT** perform implicit parser registration or unrelated global mutation.

The package **MUST** explicitly define supported public entry points through modern package `exports`. Internal file paths **MUST NOT** become accidental public API merely because files are published.

Dependencies and state **SHOULD** be explicit. Hidden singleton state, mutable global registries and action-at-a-distance behaviour **MUST NOT** be introduced where explicit ownership is simpler. Parse-session state **MUST** be isolated per operation.

Canonical OWL structural objects **MUST** remain immutable; APIs **MUST NOT** expose mutable internal collections that can violate ontology/manager invariants.

Implementations **SHOULD** favour straightforward control flow, cohesive functions and clear domain vocabulary. Clever metaprogramming, speculative abstractions, unnecessary inheritance hierarchies and generalized frameworks **SHOULD NOT** replace simpler JavaScript designs.

Asynchronous public APIs **MUST** use Promises/`async`/`await` where appropriate. New callback-style public async APIs **MUST NOT** be introduced. Cancellation-capable operations **MUST** honour the `AbortSignal` contract where specified. Floating/unobserved promises and ignored async failures **MUST NOT** be normal control flow.

Errors **MUST** use the canonical typed error taxonomy. Production code **MUST NOT** throw strings, parse error messages as program logic, silently swallow unexpected exceptions or convert programming defects into parser mismatch.

A dependency/local utility **SHOULD NOT** be introduced when the supported JavaScript/Web/Node platform already provides a clear standards-based capability. Conversely, selected mature standards libraries **MUST NOT** be reimplemented locally merely to avoid dependencies.

Portable core code **MUST NOT** directly require Node-only or browser-only globals unless isolated behind an environment adapter. Capability detection **SHOULD** test the required capability rather than guessing by user agent/runtime name.

Comments **SHOULD** explain semantics, invariants, specification rationale and non-obvious compatibility decisions rather than restating code. JSDoc **MAY** be used for documentation but **MUST NOT** create a TypeScript tooling requirement.

Authoritative semantic vocabularies, mappings, structural-kind memberships, parser metadata and capability definitions **MUST** have one source of truth wherever practical. Derived documentation/tables **SHOULD** be mechanically generated or checked to prevent drift.

Production design **MUST** permit deterministic unit/integration/security/failure-path testing without hidden global manipulation or real network access.

Before Phase 1, Phase 0 **MUST** identify the repository's applicable JavaScript formatting, linting, naming, module, testing and package conventions. New production code **MUST** comply unless this blueprint establishes a stronger requirement. A phase **MUST NOT** introduce a competing formatter, linter, module convention, test convention, build system or style regime without an approved project decision.

Engineering quality is part of Definition of Done. Review **MUST** consider architectural boundaries, cohesion/coupling, duplication, encapsulation, dependency discipline, state ownership, error/async behaviour, runtime portability, testability, clarity and current JavaScript practice. A materially inferior implementation **MUST NOT** be accepted merely because the blueprint left a physical implementation choice open.

### 13.1 Illustrative directory/package structure

Before Phase 19, `src/owlapi-js/` remains the WebVOWL staging tree. It is not the
canonical standalone layout. The history-preserving extraction places package
source at the root of `Hadden-Industries/owlapi` and applies the §2.10.4
two-zone rule. The following structure is illustrative below the public
namespace level but normative about ownership and dependency direction:

```text
Hadden-Industries/owlapi/
├── index.js
│
├── apibinding/
│   ├── index.js

```

The public namespace directories contain the canonical definitions of public
bindings plus their explicit `index.js` facades. They are not a second wrapper
tree over `internal/<same-path>`. Private parsers, translators, RDF/JS wiring,
loading orchestration and platform adapters live only under `internal/` and are
reachable from public operations through direct, acyclic dependencies.

The displayed internal subdirectories are created only when they own retained
production modules; do not add empty placeholders. Phase 19 records every
staging-to-canonical path move in the history-partition/path manifest so a
reviewer can distinguish relocation from semantic modification.

### 13.2 Repository-resident migration knowledge is a first-class project artefact

The source tree alone cannot preserve all of the reusable engineering knowledge discovered while migrating successive ontology syntaxes. Maintain a compact, curated knowledge structure in the repository so a new implementation team can inherit the project's current best method without reading historical conversations or every prior implementation diff:

```text
docs/owlapi-js/migration/
├── parser-migration-playbook.md      # current best method; continuously rewritten
├── migration-status.md               # current phase, gates, deferred items
├── lessons/
│   ├── 001-functional-syntax.md      # factual retrospective / evidence
│   ├── 002-manchester-syntax.md
│   ├── 003-owl-xml.md
│   ├── 004-dl-syntax.md
│   ├── 005-krss-family.md
│   ├── 006-n3-rdf.md
│   ├── 007-rdf-xml.md
│   └── 008-json-ld.md
├── decisions/
│   └── ADR-*.md                      # durable architectural decisions only
└── coverage/
    ├── parser-surface-matrix.md
    └── ...
```

The **lesson records** preserve history and evidence. The **playbook** is not an append-only diary: it is the current, distilled implementation guidance for the next migration and should be rewritten whenever a newer lesson supersedes an older rule. The strongest lessons should cease to depend on prose at all by becoming regression tests, architectural fitness checks, contract tests, lint/import rules or CI gates.

Every lesson record should capture at least:

- the capability and context in which the issue appeared;
- the initial assumption/hypothesis;
- what failed or proved unexpectedly effective;
- the observable symptom and root cause;
- the implemented correction;
- the **generalizable lesson**;
- an applicability tag such as `cross-cutting`, `owl-native`, `textual-lexer`, `xml`, `rdf-adapter`, `rdf-mapping`, `json-ld`, `security`, `performance`, `testing` or `syntax-local`;
- the regression/contract/conformance test that now protects the lesson;
- any shared contract or ADR changed because of it;
- implications for the next planned migration.

This structure is intentionally general software-engineering process documentation, not an AI-agent-specific memory mechanism.

### 13.3 Avoid a class-per-file explosion where it adds no value

The tree above describes canonical namespace ownership, not a mandate that every
trivial OWL type live in an isolated file. Multiple tightly related immutable
types may share one cohesive module, provided the Public API Surface Registry
maps each binding to that single canonical module and no duplicate definition
exists beneath `internal/`. Optimize for maintainability and explicit package
boundaries, not ceremonial replication of Java compilation units.

### 13.4 Tests colocated with implementation

Keep `*.test.js` alongside source modules where that matches current repository practice. Put large fixtures/corpora in dedicated test directories rather than duplicating them per parser.

---

## 14. Java OWLAPI Mapping: What to Mirror and What to Adapt

### 14.1 `OWLManager`

| Java OWLAPI                             | Recommended JS                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `OWLManager.createOWLOntologyManager()` | `OWLManager.createOWLOntologyManager(options?)` |

`OWLManager` is a convenience binding/factory. Keep it intentionally thin.

### 14.2 `OWLOntologyManager`

The normative v1 public manager surface is intentionally narrow:

```javascript
manager.getOWLDataFactory();
manager.createOntology(ontologyID?);
await manager.loadOntologyFromOntologyDocument(source, configuration?);
manager.getOntology(ontologyID); // OWLOntology | undefined
```

IRI mapping, parser registration, document context and other machinery remain internal/configuration seams unless the capability matrix explicitly promotes them to public API. Do not port Java's complete lifecycle/listener/configurator ecosystem merely because it exists upstream.

### 14.3 `OWLParser`

Java OWLAPI's important behavioural contract is that a parser recognizes a concrete syntax and contributes structural OWL content. In `owlapi-js`, the parser **MUST NOT** mutate a manager-owned ontology directly during a candidate attempt.

The internal JavaScript contract should instead operate on an isolated parse transaction/builder, conceptually:

```javascript
class OWLParser {
  parse(source, transaction, configuration) {
    // Parse into transaction-owned structural state.
    // Return/throw according to the canonical parse-outcome/error contract.
  }
}
```

This is an internal JavaScript protocol/documentation contract, not a reason to create a runtime abstract-class hierarchy or introduce TypeScript tooling.

### 14.4 Parser factory/descriptor mapping

Java parser-factory concerns map to the canonical immutable `ParserDescriptor` rather than a second public factory hierarchy.

Conceptually:

```javascript
{
  id,
  priority,
  format,
  detect(source, configuration),
  createParser,
}
```

Detection uses `MATCH | NO_MATCH | INDETERMINATE` plus `reasonCode`/`reason`; it is not a boolean `sniff()` contract. Lower numeric priority wins, with lexical parser-ID tie-breaking. Registration order **MUST NOT** affect semantics.

Concrete parser/factory objects **SHOULD NOT** become root-package public API unless the capability matrix explicitly requires an advanced parser API.

### 14.5 `IRI`

A dedicated `IRI` value object remains useful because:

- OWL structural APIs distinguish IRIs from arbitrary strings;
- validation/normalization policy has one home;
- structural keys are clearer;
- Java-facing API familiarity improves.

Do **not** use it as a URL abstraction. An IRI is not necessarily an HTTP URL.

### 14.6 `OWLOntologyID`

Represent:

```text
ontologyIRI: optional IRI
versionIRI:  optional IRI
```

Document/retrieval IRI must remain outside this identity object.

### 14.7 `OWLDataFactory`

This should become one of the first implemented model classes because every parser and translator benefits from a common construction path.

### 14.8 Java Streams and overloads

Do not emulate Java method overload ambiguity in dynamic JS. For example, instead of numerous overloaded `getAxioms(...)` signatures, prefer clearly documented methods/options until there is a proven compatibility need.

Similarly, expose iterable collections rather than creating a custom Java-Stream facsimile.

### 14.9 Public API Surface Registry and Java gap view

Maintain the §2.10.4 machine-readable Public API Surface Registry throughout
development. It supersedes an informal hand-maintained method-parity table and
must answer, for any Java OWLAPI package or public type, whether the corresponding
capability is publicly available, implemented only behind another public API,
deferred, delegated or unsupported by design.

The complete pinned Java package/type inventory is the left side of the
comparison; the capability matrix, public namespace registry and JS binding
inventory are the right side. The human-readable view is derived from those
sources and reports package-level totals with drill-down type/member rows. A
missing row is an error, not an implicit “not supported” classification.

Representative rows include:

| Java authority | Capability status | Progress | Exposure | Compatibility |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `OWLManager#createOWLOntologyManager` | `REQUIRED_V1` | `COMPLETE` | `PUBLIC` through `owlapi/apibinding` | `ADAPTED` JavaScript signature |
| `OWLOntology#getAxioms` | `REQUIRED_V1` | `COMPLETE` | `PUBLIC` through `owlapi/model` | declared compatible subset |
| `OWLRDFConsumer` observable reconstruction behavior | linked RDF→OWL capability rows | `COMPLETE` | `INTERNAL_ONLY` | behaviorally verified mapping engine |
| concrete storer/renderer families | capability-specific | capability-specific | registry-specific | no implicit exposure from Java source location |
| reasoner interfaces | `UNSUPPORTED_BY_DESIGN` for the initial line | `NOT_STARTED` | `NOT_EXPOSED` | explicit gap |

This prevents the project from claiming “OWLAPI compatible” where only names
match, while also making contribution opportunities discoverable without
requiring a developer to reconstruct omissions from source comments or commit
history.

### 14.10 Mandatory source-code annotations for deferred or unimplemented OWLAPI behaviour

The Public API Surface Registry is necessary but **not sufficient**. During this refactor, the implementer must also leave **detailed source-code annotations at the exact point where an OWLAPI capability is intentionally not implemented, only partially implemented, or behaviourally divergent**. The next engineer reading a parser, translator, manager or model class should be able to discover the limitation from the code without first reading the project plan or reverse-engineering Java OWLAPI.

This requirement applies to all OWLAPI-derived or OWLAPI-compatible surfaces, including:

- parser grammar productions and syntax constructs;
- structural object/axiom families;
- `OWLDataFactory` constructors;
- RDF→OWL handlers and OWL→RDF mappings;
- ontology-manager/loading/import behaviour;
- document formats, parser factories and compatibility dialects;
- query/index methods on `OWLOntology`;
- any Java OWLAPI overload, option, recovery rule or edge case deliberately omitted from the initial JavaScript surface.

#### Required annotation convention

Use one of two explicit markers:

```javascript
// TODO(OWLAPI parity): ...
```

for behaviour intended to be implemented later, or:

```javascript
// UNSUPPORTED(OWLAPI parity): ...
```

for behaviour deliberately outside the supported contract unless that decision is revisited.

Do **not** use vague comments such as `// TODO: support more OWL`, `// not implemented`, or `// OWLAPI does more here`. Every parity annotation must contain enough information to be actionable.

At minimum, record:

1. **The missing capability in OWL terms.** Name the exact axiom, class expression, grammar production, parser mode, manager behaviour or API operation.
2. **The Java OWLAPI compatibility reference.** Give the relevant public class/interface/method, parser/factory/format identity, behavioural fixture or Javadoc reference, plus the pinned OWLAPI version used by the project's differential harness where practical. Do not require a Java implementation handler/source location merely to make a parity comment actionable; if a source location is recorded for historical provenance, it must not be treated as an instruction to translate that implementation.
3. **The normative reference when one exists.** For OWL language semantics, cite the relevant W3C OWL 2 structural syntax, concrete-syntax or OWL↔RDF mapping section/production rather than relying solely on Java implementation behaviour.
4. **The current JavaScript behaviour.** State whether the code throws a typed unsupported-feature error, records a diagnostic, deliberately does not register a parser, exposes a reduced API, or follows some documented compatibility fallback. A limitation must never be disguised by silent omission.
5. **Why it is deferred or unsupported.** For example: not required by the current WebVOWL path, blocked on another structural type, requires RDF list support, requires import-closure work, or deliberately excluded from the initial package scope.
6. **What is required to implement it correctly.** Name prerequisite model types, translator handlers, parser productions, resource-safety work or architectural decisions so a future implementation does not patch the symptom at the wrong layer.
7. **The verification hook.** Point to the relevant parity-matrix row and, where available, a focused fixture/test or issue identifier that should change when the gap is closed.

A good annotation therefore looks like:

```javascript
// TODO(OWLAPI parity): Support ObjectHasSelf in OWL/XML.
// Java compatibility reference: pinned OWLAPI OWL/XML parser via the
// `owlxml/object-has-self.owl` structural differential fixture; public
// OWL/XML parser/format API identity recorded in the API surface registry.
// Normative semantics: OWL 2 Structural Specification ObjectHasSelf and
// Mapping to RDF Graphs for ObjectHasSelf.
// Current behaviour: strict parsing throws UnsupportedConstructError;
// compatible mode records an unsupported-construct diagnostic only for an explicitly approved recovery case.
// Deferred because OwlObjectHasSelf and its OwlToRdfTranslator mapping are
// not yet present in the structural core. Implement those first; do not
// synthesize RDF/XML directly in this parser.
// Verification: API surface registry `ObjectHasSelf`; fixture
// `owlxml/object-has-self.owl`; Java structural differential test.
```

For an intentional scope boundary:

```javascript
// UNSUPPORTED(OWLAPI parity): Java OWLAPI exposes <specific API/behaviour>,
// but owlapi-js initial scope deliberately excludes it because <reason>.
// Keep this explicit so future OWLAPI-surface audits do not mistake the
// absence for an accidental omission. See API surface registry: <row/key>.
```

#### Placement rules

The comment must be placed **at the nearest stable implementation point where a future maintainer would expect the feature to exist**:

- beside the parser dispatch/production for a missing syntax construct;
- beside the translator dispatch table for a missing OWL↔RDF mapping;
- beside the manager/configuration code for deferred loader/import semantics;
- beside the public model/query surface for an intentionally omitted OWLAPI method;
- beside a dialect capability table when a production is legal in KRSS2 but intentionally rejected in KRSS1.

Do not collect all such comments in one central “missing features” source file. The Public API Surface Registry remains the project-level Java API inventory and gap view; **source comments provide local discoverability**. Both must agree.

#### How this integrates with the parser gap-analysis process

Every gap discovered using the methodology in §3.2.5.3 must end in exactly one of three states before that parser refactor is considered reviewed:

1. **implemented and covered by a focused test**;
2. **deferred**, with a `TODO(OWLAPI parity)` annotation, parity-matrix entry and explicit runtime behaviour;
3. **unsupported by design**, with an `UNSUPPORTED(OWLAPI parity)` annotation and parity-matrix entry documenting the scope decision.

A discovered OWLAPI capability must never remain only in research notes or a review conversation. This rule applies equally when auditing Functional Syntax, Manchester Syntax, OWL/XML, DL Syntax, KRSS/KRSS1, KRSS2 and the shared RDF→OWL translator.

#### Comments are not substitutes for behaviour or tests

Parity annotations are documentation of a known boundary, not permission to silently discard input. If a parser encounters a known unimplemented construct, §2.8 still applies: strict mode must throw a typed error and any supported `compatible` recovery must match an explicitly documented recovery rule and emit its required diagnostic.

Likewise, remove or rewrite the parity annotation when the feature is implemented, and update the Public API Surface Registry and focused tests in the **same change**. Stale `TODO(OWLAPI parity)` comments are themselves compatibility defects.

Finally, describe behaviour in the project's own words. Do not paste or translate Java OWLAPI implementation code, implementation comments or control-flow descriptions into production comments. Compatibility annotations should point to public API identities, normative specifications and project-owned behavioural fixtures. Keep the implementation-independence and source-provenance requirements from §22 intact.

---

## 15. `VOWLBuilder`: the New WebVOWL Seam

### 15.1 Responsibility

`VOWLBuilder` should know OWL concepts and VOWL concepts, but **nothing about concrete ontology syntax**.

```text
OWLOntology
    ↓
VOWLBuilder
    ↓
VOWL-JSON-compatible WebVOWL structures
```

It should never:

- parse XML;
- resolve prefixes;
- inspect Turtle syntax;
- detect formats;
- reconstruct RDF lists;
- contain parser fallback logic.

### 15.2 Prefer structural traversal over RDF pattern matching

Old code may infer a restriction by spotting RDF triples. New code should consume the already-reconstructed expression:

```javascript
if (expression instanceof OWLObjectSomeValuesFrom) {
  const property = expression.getProperty();
  const filler = expression.getFiller();
  // VOWL-specific handling
}
```

This makes VOWL conversion much easier to reason about and test.

### 15.3 VOWL should not force the structural model to be shallow

Do not design `OWLOntology` merely around the handful of flattened fields that VOWL currently consumes. The structural model should faithfully represent the OWL constructs; VOWL decides which constructs it visualizes and how.

### 15.4 Development integration and cutover rule

Phase 7 may add one explicitly development-only invocation seam so the new
`OWLOntology` → `VOWLBuilder` path can be exercised in the app and end-to-end
tests before it becomes the production default. That seam must return the new
VOWL result directly; it **MUST NOT** adapt structural OWL back into the legacy
RDF/parser/converter representation.

Phase 8 rewires the existing production entry point in place and removes any
temporary development-only routing that would preserve two production paths.
After that cutover there is no runtime legacy fallback. An architecture test
and production-bundle/import-graph inspection **MUST** prove that the entry
graph cannot reach the old parser, RDF/XML interchange, `ontologyConverter.js`
or `jsonExporter.js`. The legacy files remained unmoved for characterization
and reference only until their Phase 18 physical deletion.

---

## 16. Revised File Operations

### 16.1 Legacy files retired in Phase 18

| File                                       | Final treatment                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/owl2vowl/js/rdfXmlSerializer.js`      | Deleted in Phase 18 after the shared OWL→RDF translator removed the final reference need                        |
| `src/owl2vowl/js/rdfXmlSerializer.test.js` | Deleted in Phase 18; OWL→RDF semantic tests remain in the Phase 18 `src/owlapi-js/rdf/` staging tree, while Phase 19 relocates their production subjects to cohesive private owners such as `internal/mapping/` and `internal/rdfjs/` |
| `src/owl2vowl/js/importLoader.js`          | Deleted in Phase 18 after manager orchestration and WebVOWL resolver responsibilities had moved                 |
| `src/owl2vowl/js/rdfParser.js`             | Deleted in Phase 18 after RDF→OWL, `VOWLBuilder`, corpus, and Java differential parity gates passed             |
| `src/owl2vowl/js/ontologyConverter.js`     | Made production-unreachable in Phase 8, retained through finite reference work, and deleted in Phase 18         |
| `src/owl2vowl/js/jsonExporter.js`          | Made production-unreachable in Phase 8, retained through finite reference work, and deleted in Phase 18         |

Do not move, rename or delete legacy files at cutover. They remain valuable as
characterization/reference material during the remaining migrations, but they
must be absent from the production reachability graph after Phase 8.

Phase 18 followed that sequence exactly: no legacy file was moved or rewired;
the complete retired cluster and its legacy-only tests were deleted only after
the final reference gate, while current production tests and pinned Java
fixtures remained in place.

### 16.2 Files to create in WebVOWL

| File                                | Role                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/owl2vowl/js/vowlBuilder.js`    | Pure OWL structural model → VOWL-JSON-compatible WebVOWL structures; no legacy converter/exporter dependency                          |
| `src/owl2vowl/js/importResolver.js` | WebVOWL-specific catalog/path/IRI mapping provider implementing core loader interfaces                                                |
| `src/owl2vowl/js/owlapiAdapter.js`  | **Optional Phase 7 development-only invocation seam**; remove or make unreachable when the existing entry point is rewired in Phase 8 |

### 16.3 Generic `iriResolver.js` split

Do not keep all IRI resolution in WebVOWL. Split:

- **core:** IRI, relative IRI, XML Base, abbreviated IRI/prefix rules required by syntax specs;
- **WebVOWL:** application/catalog URL rewriting and local deployment paths.

### 16.4 Generic XML utilities

Move only utilities required to parse OWL/XML/XML sources. Do not carry VOWL-specific DOM traversal into `owlapi-js`.

---

## 17. Migration Strategy — Fixed Sequential Delivery, Rolling-Wave Elaboration, Mandatory Gates

The finite v1 ontology-ingestion and cutover programme **MUST** be executed
sequentially. At most one major ontology-ingestion migration may be active at a
time, and an integration/cutover gate in the normative sequence **MUST** finish
before the following ingestion migration begins.

### 17.1 Normative WIP-locked ingestion sequence

The complete v1 WIP-locked delivery sequence is:

```text
Functional Syntax
        ↓
Manchester Syntax
        ↓
OWL/XML
        ↓
RDF/JS ingestion + shared RDF→OWL reconstruction
        ↓
RDF/XML + first-real-adapter hardening
        ↓
early development-app integration
        ↓
production WebVOWL cutover
(legacy files retained in place, production-disconnected)
        ↓
N3.js adapter foundation + strict Turtle
        ↓
DL Syntax
        ↓
KRSS2 / KRSS-family migration
        ↓
N-Triples
        ↓
N-Quads
        ↓
TriG
        ↓
JSON-LD
        ↓
shared OWL→RDF
        ↓
original KRSS / KRSS1
        ↓
physical legacy deletion
        ↓
standalone `owlapi@0.1.0-alpha.0` package / `next` release
        ↓
production-contract verification / production corrections / `0.1.0-rc.N`
        ↓
public `owlapi@0.1.0` / normally `latest` / exact production-cutover WebVOWL dependency
```

Each numbered phase **MUST** complete its Definition of Done and applicable
learning or acceptance gate, then pause for the requested Git checkpoint. The
next phase **MUST NOT** begin until that checkpoint is committed and the
repository owner explicitly instructs the implementation to proceed.

Phase 20 is not another ingestion-format migration or a semantic feature phase.
It follows the same checkpoint rule because it freezes the production 0.1 public
contract, corrects only demonstrated failures in the accepted surface, and
performs external publication. It begins only after the Phase 19 alpha
publication checkpoint and completes with verified production `0.1.0` and the exact
WebVOWL production dependency, except that §2.33 replaces the cutover coordinate
with the first corrective patch only when published `0.1.0` fails mandatory
post-publication verification. The separate follow-on plan owns subsequent
semantic feature work.

For v1, the following are normatively classified as major ontology-ingestion migrations:

1. Functional Syntax structural-parser migration;
2. Manchester Syntax structural-parser migration;
3. OWL/XML structural-parser migration;
4. syntax-independent RDF/JS ingestion and shared `RdfToOwlTranslator`
   implementation;
5. RDF/XML adapter migration and first-real-adapter hardening;
6. N3.js-backed Turtle adapter migration;
7. DL Syntax structural-parser migration;
8. KRSS2/KRSS-family structural-parser migration;
9. N3.js-backed N-Triples adapter migration;
10. N3.js-backed N-Quads adapter migration;
11. N3.js-backed TriG adapter migration;
12. JSON-LD adapter migration; and
13. original KRSS/KRSS1 structural-parser migration.

An implementation team **MUST NOT** relabel one of these items as “infrastructure”, “translator work” or “refactoring” to execute it concurrently with another active ingestion migration.

Phases 7 and 8 are mandatory development-integration and production-cutover
gates inside this sequence. They are not permission to start the Turtle
migration concurrently. Phase 9 remains blocked until the Phase 8 production
reachability, supported-format and unsupported-format gates pass and the Phase
8 Git checkpoint is committed.

Phase 11 established KRSS1's distinct compatibility identity, grammar-gap evidence and future insertion seam while its implementation was deferred at that checkpoint. The approved Phase 17 promotion now completes that distinct parser after the shared OWL→RDF gate; it does not reopen or relabel the completed KRSS2 surface.

### 17.2 Preparatory and concurrent non-ingestion work

Work **MAY** proceed concurrently when it does not independently implement or materially redefine another source-to-OWL ingestion path. Examples include fixture acquisition, corpus curation, test/CI infrastructure, provenance auditing, documentation, benchmark/security tooling, packaging/release automation and unrelated WebVOWL development.

Preparatory future-phase work **MAY** identify specifications, collect fixtures, prepare Java behavioural-reference fixtures, classify conformance tests, perform dependency/provenance research and draft future execution contracts.

Preparatory work **MUST NOT** implement the future parser/adapter, syntax-specific semantic mapping, production routing or shared-contract hardening specifically against that future syntax.

### 17.3 Mandatory learning loop

Every major ingestion migration follows:

```text
IMPLEMENT
  ↓
VERIFY
  ↓
INTEGRATE
  ↓
LEARN
  ↓
INSTITUTIONALIZE
  ↓
HAND OFF
  ↓
NEXT IMPLEMENTATION
```

Maintain both:

- a canonical current `parser-migration-playbook.md` containing the best current reusable method; and
- immutable/historical per-migration lesson records preserving evidence and rationale.

Important reusable lessons **SHOULD** become executable tests/contracts/fitness/security/performance checks whenever they can be expressed deterministically.

### 17.4 Mandatory learning-gate record and dispositions

Every major ingestion migration **MUST** complete a formal learning gate after implementation acceptance and before the next migration begins.

Each migration **MUST** produce one evidence-oriented lesson record containing at least:

- phase/migration ID and name;
- baseline commit/revision;
- completion commit/revision;
- implemented scope;
- planned assumptions entering the phase;
- discoveries;
- failed approaches and why they failed;
- root causes or best-supported explanations;
- relevant measurements;
- compatibility findings;
- every material lesson/finding with applicability classification;
- institutionalization action(s);
- links to tests, fixtures, ADRs, contracts, capability-matrix entries, benchmarks, conformance cases and issues as applicable;
- unresolved questions and their dependency impact.

Each material finding **MUST** have a stable ID and enough evidence to be understood without relying on chat history or individual memory.

Applicability classifications **MUST** support at least:

```text
CROSS_CUTTING
OWL_NATIVE
TEXTUAL_PARSER
XML
RDF_ADAPTER
RDF_MAPPING
SECURITY
PERFORMANCE
TESTING
PROVENANCE
SYNTAX_LOCAL
```

A finding **MAY** have multiple applicability classifications. `SYNTAX_LOCAL` **MUST NOT** be used merely to avoid applying an inconvenient lesson elsewhere.

Every material finding **MUST** have exactly one primary disposition:

```text
NO_CHANGE
PLAYBOOK_UPDATE
TEST_OR_FITNESS_UPDATE
LOCAL_PHASE_FOLLOW_UP
PROPOSED_NORMATIVE_CHANGE
```

`NO_CHANGE` **MUST** include rationale explaining why no durable action is required.

`PLAYBOOK_UPDATE` requires the canonical playbook update before gate closure.

`TEST_OR_FITNESS_UPDATE` requires the applicable regression/contract/conformance/architecture/security/resource/performance protection before gate closure.

`LOCAL_PHASE_FOLLOW_UP` **MUST** be completed before gate closure.

`PROPOSED_NORMATIVE_CHANGE` follows §17.6 governance. A non-blocking normative proposal may remain tracked only when the next phase does not depend on it and the existing normative rule remains authoritative.

Every unresolved question on which the **next migration depends** **MUST** be resolved before handoff. Non-blocking questions may remain explicitly tracked only when their unresolved state cannot alter the next phase's required behaviour.

The gate passes only when:

```text
unclassified material findings = 0
unfinished LOCAL_PHASE_FOLLOW_UP items = 0
unapplied required PLAYBOOK_UPDATE items = 0
unapplied required TEST_OR_FITNESS_UPDATE items = 0
blocking normative proposals = 0
unresolved next-phase dependency questions = 0
phase Definition of Done = PASS
```

The gate **MUST** produce a mechanically reviewable completion summary containing at least the migration identifier, lesson-record path, finding IDs/dispositions, whether the playbook changed, executable protections added/changed, normative-change proposals, unresolved blockers and the next migration.

### 17.5 Institutionalization and handoff

The canonical playbook represents the **current best method**, not a chronological diary. Each gate **MUST** remove/supersede obsolete guidance, narrow over-broad guidance and prevent syntax-local lessons from becoming universal accidentally.

Before gate closure, the team **MUST** review every not-yet-started ingestion migration for material impact from newly discovered cross-cutting lessons.

The next team receives the repository-resident current playbook, institutionalized tests/contracts, completed lesson record, current normative architecture, capability matrix and phase execution contract. It **MUST NOT** need to reconstruct required behaviour from chat history, oral history, commit archaeology or every historical lesson file.

### 17.6 Learning-gate decision authority and plan changes

The active implementation team **MAY** refactor private implementation details, add tests, improve performance within budgets, improve non-contractual diagnostics, update syntax-local historical lessons and refine the playbook where no normative contract changes.

The team **MUST NOT** unilaterally change:

- normative architecture;
- public API;
- shared parser/model/RDF/loader/diagnostics/translator contracts;
- capability classifications;
- v1 scope;
- ingestion order or phase boundaries/prerequisites;
- phase Definition of Done;
- security policy;
- resource/performance budgets;
- dependency selections;
- provenance policy;
- compatibility/expected-difference policy;
- conformance classifications;
- another phase's required assumptions.

Such a change requires:

1. an ADR or equivalent approved project decision;
2. approval by the repository-defined project decision authority;
3. update of every affected normative artefact in the same accepted change;
4. updated tests/contracts where observable behaviour changes;
5. updated downstream phase contracts where assumptions change.

Implementation **MUST NOT** proceed on the proposed new rule until those updates are approved and committed.

An ADR does not silently override stale normative text: the ADR preserves reasoning; the current normative artefact preserves the current rule.

Before Phase 0 completes, the repository **MUST** identify the role/governance mechanism authorized to approve normative changes.

An active team may **propose** reordering future not-yet-started migrations, but it **MUST NOT** enact the reorder itself. Any approved reorder updates the normative sequence/prerequisites/status artefacts and still preserves the one-ingestion-migration WIP lock.

The current post-Phase-4 reorder, early integration/cutover rules, retained
legacy-file policy and Turtle-first N3.js sequencing were approved in
`docs/adr/0002-prioritize-rdf-ingestion-and-early-webvowl-cutover.md` and are
incorporated normatively throughout this plan.

The post-Phase-16 promotion of original KRSS/KRSS1 to `REQUIRED_V1`, its Phase
17 execution contract, the narrower-KRSS1-first generic `.krss` policy and the
renumbering of legacy deletion/package release to Phases 18/19 were approved in
`docs/adr/0008-promote-original-krss1-into-v1.md`.

### 17.7 Phase 0 — freeze behaviour, provenance, governance, conformance and budgets

Before production migration begins:

- pin the Java OWLAPI behavioural oracle and reference harness;
- establish the authoritative capability matrix;
- establish provenance dispositions required by §22;
- establish the repository decision authority;
- establish the canonical migration playbook and lesson-record schema;
- inventory the complete OWLAPI parser/format surface, including KRSS1/KRSS2 identities;
- pin applicable standards-conformance suites/manifests;
- measure the corpus and establish normative resource/performance budgets;
- capture current WebVOWL/legacy characterization fixtures and benchmark baselines;
- identify repository JavaScript engineering conventions.

Phase 0 **MUST** resolve any `REVIEW_EXCEPTION` provenance item that blocks Phase 1.

### 17.8 Phase 1 — structural core primitives and construction seams

Introduce the structural model, `OWLObjectKind`, exhaustive dispatch infrastructure, immutable structural objects, structural equality/keying, `OWLDataFactory`, `OWLOntology`, manager/source/config/error foundations and canonical RDF/JS contracts needed by subsequent phases.

Phase 1 **MUST NOT** add TypeScript tooling.

### 17.9 Phase 2 — Functional Syntax

Implement Functional Syntax directly to the structural model using the Phase 1 construction seams. Complete its conformance/differential/resource/performance acceptance and mandatory learning gate.

### 17.10 Phase 3 — Manchester Syntax

Implement Manchester Syntax directly to the structural model, inheriting all applicable Functional/parser-framework lessons. Complete acceptance and learning gate.

### 17.11 Phase 4 — OWL/XML

Implement OWL/XML directly to the structural model, inheriting textual-parser lessons where applicable and adding XML/environment/security lessons. Complete acceptance and learning gate.

### 17.12 Phase 5 — canonical RDF ingestion and shared RDF→OWL reconstruction

Complete the syntax-independent RDF ingestion path before activating any new
RDF syntax adapter. Implement the shared `RdfToOwlTranslator`, complete and
verify the dataset graph policy, and translate selected RDF graphs to the
canonical structural model through `OWLDataFactory` and ontology transactions.

Phase 5 tests **MUST** enter through constructed canonical RDF/JS datasets, not
through an RDF syntax parser. They must establish a finite W3C OWL-to-RDF
mapping inventory in the reverse direction, Java OWLAPI behavioural
differentials, ontology header/import/annotation reconstruction, class and data
expressions, property expressions and characteristics, assertions, keys,
negative assertions, disjointness, axiom annotations, blank-node scope, RDF
list cycle/length protection, unconsumed OWL-significant triple policy,
diagnostics, abort/timeout/resource handling and transactional rollback.

No RDF/XML-, Turtle- or other syntax-specific reconstruction rule may enter the
translator. Complete the Phase 5 learning gate before RDF/XML begins.

### 17.13 Phase 6 — RDF/XML and first-real-adapter hardening

Implement the selected `rdfxml-streaming-parser` adapter, inheriting the Phase
4 XML/environment/security lessons and terminating at canonical RDF/JS quads.
Run the independently owned W3C RDF/XML syntax classifications at the
syntax/RDF seam, then run shared RDF→OWL, Java structural differential,
import-closure, WebVOWL, resource, abort, browser/Node, heap and performance
acceptance.

Any semantic gap exposed by RDF/XML **MUST** be corrected and tested in the
shared translator unless the defect is demonstrably RDF/XML syntax
normalization. Complete the Phase 6 learning gate before development-app
integration begins.

### 17.14 Phase 7 — early development-app integration

Implement `VOWLBuilder` as a direct `OWLOntology` → VOWL-JSON-compatible WebVOWL
module and make the new ingestion/conversion path explicitly invocable in the
development app and end-to-end tests. It must not adapt structural OWL back to
the legacy RDF/parser/converter representation.

The production default remains unchanged for this checkpoint. The Phase 7
acceptance gate includes exact differential evidence, supported and malformed
RDF/XML fixtures, import closure, empty/anonymous ontologies, resource
failures, and confirmation that the new builder has no concrete-syntax
knowledge. Pause for the Phase 7 Git checkpoint before cutover.

### 17.15 Phase 8 — production WebVOWL cutover

Rewrite the existing WebVOWL production entry path in place to use
`owlapi-js` → `OWLOntology` → `VOWLBuilder`. Do not move, rename or delete any
legacy file. Remove temporary development routing that would create two
production implementations.

After cutover, the production import/bundle graph **MUST NOT** reach the legacy
parsers, RDF/XML serializer/bridge, `ontologyConverter.js` or
`jsonExporter.js`. Enforce this with a static architecture test plus production
bundle/import-graph inspection. There is no runtime legacy fallback.

At this checkpoint WebVOWL advertises only Functional Syntax, Manchester
Syntax, OWL/XML and RDF/XML from the new path. Any other legacy-only syntax,
including one discovered in an import closure, must fail explicitly with the
canonical unsupported-format diagnostics. The legacy sources remain at their
existing paths for characterization/reference tests only. Complete production
smoke, differential, import, unsupported-format and reachability acceptance,
then pause for the Phase 8 Git checkpoint before Turtle begins.

### 17.16 Phase 9 — private N3.js adapter foundation and strict Turtle

Introduce one private format-locked N3.js implementation behind the existing
RDF syntax seam and register only the Turtle descriptor. Always select explicit
Turtle mode; the dependency's permissive default mode is forbidden. Normalize
terms/quads/errors immediately, preserve prefix/document context, and pass the
canonical dataset through the already shared graph-policy and RDF→OWL modules.

N3.js should be conditionally imported after parser selection. Establish a
measured bounded streaming/chunking path for large inputs with Unicode-safe
chunks, backpressure, abort/timeout/quad-limit checks and cooperative browser
yielding. No third-party type, stream, error or undeclared transitive dependency
may leak past the private implementation.

Complete the independently owned RDF 1.1 and RDF 1.2 Turtle classifications,
strict Notation3-negative tests, bounded detection and strong-negative tests,
Node/browser adapter contracts, bundle/first-use/main-thread measurements,
resource and long-list cases, Java structural differentials, paired
RDF/XML/Turtle structural equivalence, import closure and complete WebVOWL
conversion. N-Triples, N-Quads, TriG and the broader N3 language remain
unregistered. Complete the Phase 9 learning gate before DL Syntax begins.

### 17.17 Phase 10 — DL Syntax

Implement DL Syntax directly to the structural model using the matured textual-parser contracts and all applicable resource, detection, diagnostics and differential lessons. Complete acceptance and learning gate.

### 17.18 Phase 11 — KRSS family

Implement the `REQUIRED_V1` KRSS2/KRSS-family parser scope, retain explicit KRSS1 compatibility identity, perform the required KRSS1/KRSS2 grammar-gap/fixture/negative-dialect work, and leave a tested KRSS1 insertion seam without registering a KRSS1 parser at this checkpoint. Complete acceptance and learning gate. The later Phase 17 promotion does not rewrite this historical checkpoint; it builds on it.

### 17.19 Phase 12 — N-Triples

Add the distinct strict N-Triples format/descriptor through the private N3.js
implementation established in Phase 9. Complete its independent W3C RDF 1.1
and RDF 1.2 classifications, bounded detection, default-graph normalization,
adapter replacement, differential, resource/performance and learning gates.

### 17.20 Phase 13 — N-Quads

Add the distinct strict N-Quads format/descriptor through the same private
implementation. Preserve every graph term and use this simplest line-oriented
dataset syntax to validate every dataset graph policy with real parsed input.
Complete independent conformance, differential, resource/performance and
learning gates.

### 17.21 Phase 14 — TriG

Add the distinct strict TriG format/descriptor after both Turtle syntax and
N-Quads named-graph behavior are established. Validate the combination of
Turtle-style syntax, graph blocks, dataset graph selection/loss diagnostics,
cross-format equivalence, conformance, resource/performance and learning gates.

### 17.22 Phase 15 — JSON-LD

Implement the Digital Bazaar `jsonld.js` adapter with restricted/injected document loading and no N-Quads string round-trip. Complete acceptance and its ingestion-program learning gate.

The reusable parser surface is not limited by WebVOWL's current controls. The
JSON-LD document format **MUST** expose JSON-LD 1.0/1.1 `processingMode`, an
externally supplied `expandContext`, and both JSON-LD 1.1 `rdfDirection`
representations (`i18n-datatype` and `compound-literal`). External expansion
contexts use the same injected restricted loader as document `@context`
references; no second network path is permitted. `rdf:JSON` values **MUST**
retain their JSON data model and use a JCS-canonical lexical form.

JSON-LD 1.0 compatibility normalization may cover exact normative differences
that the selected current processor no longer implements, but it **MUST** remain
isolated before/after delegated expansion and **MUST NOT** become a second
general context-expansion implementation. Generalized RDF remains outside the
ontology-ingestion contract because blank-node predicates cannot cross the
ordinary RDF/JS and OWL-property boundary.

The pinned W3C inventory gate requires 462 applicable to-RDF cases to pass. Only
the two generalized-RDF cases and individually enumerated dependency defects may
remain `EXCLUDED_WITH_REASON`; test-runner options or a current consumer's UI
are not exclusion reasons.

At the Phase 15 checkpoint, the then-approved ingestion programme was complete. The subsequently approved Phase 17 KRSS1 promotion is an explicit capability-matrix and plan change under §17.6; the expanded v1 ingestion programme is complete only after Phase 17 passes.

### 17.23 Phase 16 — shared OWL→RDF translator

Implement the W3C OWL→RDF mapping from canonical structural OWL to RDF/JS quads using exhaustive `kind` dispatch and graph-equivalence tests.

### 17.24 Phase 17 — original KRSS / KRSS1

Implement the OWLAPI-style original KRSS/KRSS1 parser as the final
`REQUIRED_V1` ingestion migration. Phase 17 **MUST** reuse the Phase 11 bounded
lexer and dialect evidence only where syntax and observable semantics are
genuinely common. It **MUST NOT** copy the KRSS2 parser, accept a permissive
union of both dialects, or expose one adapter under two format identities.

#### 17.24.1 Architecture and preservation boundary

The KRSS family **MUST** have one dialect-neutral core with separate KRSS1 and
KRSS2 adapters. The shared core owns only common token consumption, expression
parsing, construction seams and bounded-resource mechanics. Each adapter owns
its top-level production set, dialect validation, format identity, descriptor,
detection, diagnostics, fixtures and Java behavioural-oracle snapshot.

Conceptually, the implementation should deepen the existing `parser/krss/`
module with a shared parser core and bounded detection helpers while retaining
distinct `parser/krss1/` and `parser/krss2/` entry points. Exact filenames are
non-normative under §13.1. Before extracting any completed KRSS2 machinery,
tests **MUST** lock its accepted structural output, rejection boundaries,
diagnostics, resource behavior, registry identity and benchmark signals. The
refactor is complete only if those controls remain green.

#### 17.24.2 Finite grammar and behavioural-oracle inventory

Before production implementation, Phase 17 **MUST** freeze a finite inventory
covering at least:

- TBox-before-ABox whole-document ordering and the accepted `end-tbox` /
  `end-abox` delimiter behavior;
- `define-primitive-concept`, `define-concept`, `define-primitive-role`,
  `transitive`, `range`, `instance`, `related`, `equal` and `distinct`;
- `and`, `or`, `not`, `all`, `some`, `at-least`, `at-most` and `exactly`
  expressions, including nesting and cardinality boundaries;
- reserved-word/entity-name behavior, IRI resolution, comments, whitespace,
  empty documents, duplicate statements and trailing input;
- definition consistency and the structural axioms produced by primitive and
  complete concept definitions; and
- primitive-role super-role requirements plus the accepted and observable
  behavior of `:right-identity`.

Published KRSS-family material and public OWLAPI API metadata are the
implementation authorities; the pinned OWLAPI 5.5.1 `KRSSOWLParser` is a
black-box behavioural oracle. Parser acceptance and renderer output **MUST** be
probed separately: a renderer's chosen subset or spelling neither defines the
parser grammar nor proves that a production has semantics. If the Java parser
accepts a production but observably drops it, Phase 17 **MUST** record and test
an approved compatibility decision or controlled correction rather than
silently copying the no-op.

#### 17.24.3 Corpus provenance and evidence classes

The pre-phase provenance review found **zero** qualifying public historical
ontology artifacts for both strict OWLAPI-style KRSS1 and KRSS2. A qualifying
artifact would require all of the following: community value, preserved source
bytes, first-party maintenance or authorship in the claimed dialect, exact
dialect identification, credible release history and lawful public
redistribution. Historical GO/NCIt conversions whose original bytes or
first-party dialect authorship cannot be established, projections from modern
ontologies, reconstructed publication snippets, renamed exports and related
KRSS-family languages do not satisfy that intersection.

Phase 17 **MUST** create a machine-readable KRSS conformance/corpus register
containing at least:

```json
{
  "historicalCorpus": {
    "status": "NO_QUALIFYING_PUBLIC_ARTIFACT_VERIFIED",
    "qualifyingArtifactCount": 0
  }
}
```

The register **MUST** keep these evidence classes separate:

1. project-owned positive grammar fixtures;
2. historical adjacent-dialect fixtures;
3. extended-KRSS/KRSS2 negative fixtures;
4. converted real-ontology fixtures; and
5. future first-party strict historical-corpus artifacts.

Only class 5 may be described as a historical KRSS1/KRSS2 ontology corpus, and
it is empty at Phase 17 entry. No GO, NCIt, SNOMED-style `defconcept`, CLASSIC,
KRIS/MOTEL, BACK, GRAIL, Ontylog or other adjacent artifact may be relabeled as
strict KRSS1 without artifact-specific evidence satisfying every criterion
above. No external artifact is required merely to make the fixture tree look
non-empty.

#### 17.24.4 Deterministic dialect selection

Explicit `KRSS1` and `KRSS2` format selections, including their exact media
types, are authoritative and **MUST NOT** cross-fallback. `.krss2` is a KRSS2
hint. Definite KRSS2-only top-level vocabulary is `NO_MATCH` for KRSS1 and
`MATCH` for KRSS2. Shared-only KRSS syntax is dialect-ambiguous rather than
positive evidence for either extension level.

For automatic loading with only a generic unresolved `.krss` hint, the registry
**MUST** try the narrower KRSS1 descriptor before KRSS2; this is an explicit
semantic policy, not registration-order behavior. Content evidence still
outranks media type, descriptor priority and extension under §9.4. Once either
dialect claims the syntax, malformed or unsupported content is
`RECOGNIZED_FORMAT_FAILURE` and **MUST NOT** fall through to the other KRSS
dialect or an unrelated ontology syntax.

#### 17.24.5 Acceptance and learning gate

Phase 17 is complete only when all of the following pass:

- finite grammar-inventory tests for every required production and boundary;
- KRSS1/KRSS2 dialect-matrix tests covering explicit selection, shared syntax,
  extension-only syntax, generic `.krss`, exact `.krss2`, strong negatives and
  recognized-format failures;
- a pinned Java `KRSSOWLParser` structural fixture plus explicit records for any
  controlled difference;
- cross-format structural equivalence against supported Functional,
  Manchester, OWL/XML, RDF/XML, Turtle, DL and KRSS2 representations of the
  same project-owned subset;
- TBox/ABox ordering, malformed-input, typed-diagnostic, transaction rollback,
  abort, timeout, token/input/axiom/nesting limit and adversarial-resource tests;
- explicit-format, automatic-detection, import-closure, browser/Node, WebVOWL
  production-entry and VOWL conversion tests;
- proof that completed KRSS2 behavior and all existing advertised formats
  remain unchanged;
- same-revision parser-registry and representative-document performance/heap
  comparison within the existing budgets;
- the machine-readable zero-corpus/evidence-class register, capability/provenance
  updates, production code comments for non-obvious compatibility decisions,
  and a Phase 17 lesson record such as `migration/lessons/016-krss1.md`; and
- an updated canonical playbook with zero unfinished local follow-ups or
  unresolved next-phase dependencies.

The KRSS1 descriptor and advertised-format entry **MUST NOT** become production
reachable before the complete gate passes. At gate closure,
`parser.krss1.progress` changes from `NOT_STARTED` to `COMPLETE`, and the team
pauses for the requested Git checkpoint before any legacy deletion begins.

Phase 17 closed this gate on 22 August 2026. Its executable evidence is the
KRSS1 grammar/detection/differential/resource/integration suite, the preserved
KRSS2 suite, `GenerateKRSS1SyntaxSnapshot.java`, the finite
`krss1-behavioral-oracle.json`, `krss-corpus-register.json`, the accepted
same-revision benchmark in `performance/baseline.md`, and lesson record
`migration/lessons/016-krss1.md`. Signed checkpoint
`f91ca99deeba3ebad422259ef5514f031477771d` closed the boundary before Phase 18.

### 17.25 Phase 18 — remove the retained legacy pipeline

Delete the legacy parsers, RDF/XML bridge/serializer,
`ontologyConverter.js`, `jsonExporter.js` and other syntax-coupled VOWL paths
only after all planned replacement/reference work has passed acceptance and the
Phase 8 production no-reachability gate remains green. Phase 18 is physical
deletion, not the production cutover.

Phase 18 closed this gate on 22 August 2026. It deleted 16 legacy implementation
modules and their paired characterization tests plus the test-only legacy
pipeline composition and legacy corpus differential: 34 files in total. The
current `index.js`, `VOWLBuilder`, import resolver, constants, production corpus
differential, semantic comparison utilities, and pinned Java OWL2VOWL fixtures
remain. Two legacy-oracle-only cases were removed from the surviving focused
differential; their structural behavior remains covered by direct builder tests
and the pinned Java oracle.

`src/productionGraph.architecture.test.js` was observed failing for exactly all
34 paths before deletion and now proves both physical absence and continued
production reachability through `owlapi-js`, `VOWLBuilder`, and the WebVOWL
resolver. Provenance schema v4 preserves every deleted artifact's historical
disposition—including the approved commit-bounded reuse rules—while excluding
only explicit `DELETED` records from the live source inventory. The obsolete
`test:legacy` command and Jest ignore rule were removed, and the corpus helper
now mirrors the production resolver's exact catalog lookup rather than the
retired basename heuristic.

Acceptance is green: the post-deletion production/architecture/corpus group
passes 129 tests, governance passes 22 tests, and the default runner discovers
and passes 161 suites and 3,146 tests. Formatting, HTML/CSS/JavaScript lint, the
Vite production build, and the N3.js/jsonld.js lazy-closure verifier pass. No
dependency, lockfile, public runtime API, resource ceiling, or performance
threshold changed. Because the deleted modules were already outside the
production graph, Phase 18 requires build/closure verification rather than a
new parser-throughput baseline. The requested Git checkpoint remains the
boundary before Phase 19 packaging/release work.

### 17.26 Phase 19 — extract canonical repository and publish standalone package

Phase 19 turns the already production-used core into the independently
governed, installable package decided in §2.10. It creates the independent
public `Hadden-Industries/owlapi` repository, transfers the package's curated
history and continuing documentation to it, publishes the reviewed artefact,
and converts WebVOWL from source owner to ordinary exact-version consumer. It is
release engineering, not another semantic migration: parser/model/translator
behaviour may change only through the ordinary test-first defect/capability
process, never merely to make extraction or packing convenient. The phase
starts only from the committed Phase 18 state and keeps retired WebVOWL
parser/converter/bridge code absent.

The public API and semantic capability inventory for `0.1.0-alpha.0` are frozen
by §2.11. Packaging work may reveal a genuine defect in an already accepted
capability; correcting it requires the ordinary failing regression,
compatibility/provenance update and review path. It does not authorize pulling
any follow-on query, mutation, merger or storer capability into this phase.

#### 17.26.1 History partition, repository handoff and configuration approval

The current `feature/ui-ux-enhancements` lineage contains interleaved package
migration, WebVOWL integration, UI/UX and general repository changes. A simple
whole-repository fork or single-path snapshot would therefore be both too broad
and too weak. Before creating the canonical repository, freeze the approved
source commit and create a machine-readable history-partition manifest covering
every commit from the selected common WebVOWL base through the Phase 18
checkpoint. Each commit has exactly one primary classification:

```text
OWLAPI_PACKAGE
WEBVOWL_INTEGRATION
WEBVOWL_UI_UX
SHARED_BUILD_OR_DEPENDENCY
UNRELATED
MIXED_REQUIRES_SPLIT
```

The manifest records original commit ID, parents, subject, classification,
selected/excluded paths, rationale and—after rewriting—each resulting canonical
commit ID. `MIXED_REQUIRES_SPLIT` commits are partitioned by reviewed changes,
not accepted wholesale merely because they touch one package file. A split
result may map one original commit to an `owlapi` commit, a clean WebVOWL UI/UX
replay commit and/or a WebVOWL integration replay commit. An excluded original
commit still receives an explicit reason; no commit silently disappears from
the accounting.

The original mixed remote branch **MUST** remain unchanged as reconstruction
evidence until all extracted/replayed histories pass their gates. Do not force-
rewrite or delete it during extraction. Reconstruct unrelated UI/UX work on a
separately named branch in the existing `Hadden-Industries/webvowl` repository,
not in `owlapi` and not in another maintained WebVOWL repository. The exact
branch creation/push is a separate external-state action. It must replay only
the UI/UX changes and genuinely required shared build changes from the chosen
WebVOWL base, with mixed commits split and behaviour verified. Package-consumer
integration remains a distinct WebVOWL change applied after registry
publication.

Create `Hadden-Industries/owlapi` as a new, public, independent repository—not
through GitHub's fork operation and not as a mirror. Perform the history rewrite
only in a disposable clone. Use exact `git-filter-repo@2.47.0` under the §2.54
download/tag/commit/digest controls and reviewed
path/commit selection to:

1. retain package implementation and package-owned tests;
2. retain reusable package conformance/reference/benchmark infrastructure and
   continuing package documentation selected by the ownership inventory;
3. rename the contents of `src/owlapi-js/` to the single-package repository
   root rather than nesting the package under a WebVOWL-era path;
4. rename continuing `docs/owlapi-js/` material into the package repository's
   `docs/` hierarchy—including moving the deferred W3C reporting plan to
   `docs/plans/w3c-test-conformance-reporting.md`—while leaving
   application-specific integration material in WebVOWL; and
5. exclude WebVOWL UI, graph, VOWL conversion, deployment and application code
   from the `owlapi` history and current tree.

Because filtering changes commit trees and therefore commit IDs, retain the
tool-generated original-to-rewritten commit map as repository provenance. Also
record the source repository URL, its upstream relationship, source checkpoint,
included/excluded path rules, tool/version, exact commands, source/destination
tree IDs and a path-normalized SHA-256 manifest proving that every admitted file
is byte-identical before deliberate repository-layout/packaging edits. Preserve
original author and author-date metadata. An unsplit commit retains its accurate
original subject/body; a split commit receives a scope-accurate message plus an
`Origin-Commit: <webvowl-sha>` trailer, while the partition manifest retains the
original subject. Do not let rename/copy heuristics or a whole-commit subject
misrepresent a selectively replayed change. The public origin statement links
to the exact source checkpoint; GitHub's fork badge is not used as a substitute
for this evidence.

Before the handoff, run a mechanically checked package-boundary audit against
the WebVOWL staging tree. Production modules under `src/owlapi-js/` may import
only files inside that tree or declared external runtime dependencies. Package
tests and supporting tools/fixtures must be classified by repository ownership;
everything required for package CI is transferred or deliberately replaced so
the new repository can clone, install and test without any WebVOWL checkout.
If core production or package-test imports escape through an unowned WebVOWL
path, repair the isolation leak; do not publish the path or hide it by copying
unclassified material.

The canonical-repository handoff occurs only after the filtered checkout passes
the full package suite and the normalized source/hash manifests agree. Record
the exact final WebVOWL source commit and first canonical `owlapi` commit. From
that marker onward, package changes occur only in `Hadden-Industries/owlapi`.
The frozen WebVOWL staging copy may exist only for the finite candidate/cutover
window and receives no new package work; it is deleted from the WebVOWL working
tree when the registry dependency is integrated. Historical Git objects remain
available as provenance.

Before changing configuration, the implementer **MUST** present for explicit
approval the exact proposed contents/setting changes for:

- creation of the public independent `Hadden-Industries/owlapi` repository,
  including description, visibility, `main` as the sole default/integration
  branch, organization roles, squash-only merge settings, the exact §2.30
  `main` and `v*` rulesets, the exact GitHub-Actions-owned `CI / required`
  aggregate plus separately required CodeQL check, conditional-review transition,
  emergency bypass, the §2.59 `all_external_contributors` fork-workflow approval
  policy, disabled “Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests”,
  public/non-sensitive-only repository/organization variables, enabled Issues,
  disabled Discussions, 90-day Actions
  artifact/log retention, CodeQL JavaScript default setup/default query suite,
  required high/critical code-scanning results, secret scanning, push protection
  and security features;
- the canonical root `package.json` and package lockfile, including `name`,
  `version`, §2.39 description/keywords and deliberately omitted metadata,
  `type`, the exact §2.43 direct `exports` targets and prohibited fallback/
  pattern/metadata exports, the §2.24 exact `files` allowlist,
  absence of the §2.23 automatic lifecycle hooks and §2.26 TypeScript metadata,
  §2.44-required `sideEffects: false`, the §2.45 literal npm-native
  `devEngines` values and deliberate absence of `engines.npm`/top-level
  `packageManager`, the exact-pinned §2.32 direct runtime dependencies, the
  §2.48 absence of shrinkwrap/bundled/peer/optional/override dependency
  authority and repository-only lockfile, the §2.19-fixed Node engine range,
  the alpha Browserslist query, the exact §2.54 development dependencies
  `semver@7.8.5`, `@jspm/generator@2.16.3`,
  `@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm@6.0.1`, `ajv@8.20.0`,

The approved repository settings **MUST** implement §§2.30, 2.58, 2.59, 2.60 and
2.61, not merely
name them in policy prose. The evidence records the effective ruleset JSON/
screenshots, the exact `CI / required` GitHub Actions identity and separate
CodeQL requirement, merge methods, bypass actors and proof that the
independent-review requirement remains deliberately inactive throughout this
plan. Any later activation is a separately approved post-plan configuration
change made only when a second genuine code maintainer exists; adding a nominal
account purely to satisfy a counter is forbidden.

The effective Actions settings also prove that every external-contributor run
requires per-run maintainer approval, workflow-created/approved pull requests
are disabled, default authority is read-only and no sensitive value is stored in
a repository/organization variable. That execution approval is recorded as
permission to spend unprivileged CI only; it neither satisfies code review nor
changes the first-external-contribution rights gate in §2.14.

That conditional code-review rule does not change §2.35. Both `npm-release` and
`release-manual` require an explicit reviewer click but deliberately permit the
initiating named release custodian to supply it; both leave prevent-self-review
disabled. `release-manual` additionally has no secrets or variables and every
job reference sets `deployment: false`. A future independent deployment gate is
a separate approval from activating independent pull-request review.

The approved package manifest **MUST** give all six §2.32 foundational runtime
dependencies exact versions, and the lockfile **MUST** resolve those same
versions. The approved Dependabot configuration proposes updates under §2.32
without introducing Renovate or auto-merge. Every Action reference in an
approved workflow is one of the five exact §2.56 repository/release/full-SHA
rows, with its reviewed release tag in an adjacent comment. The repository
setting requires full-SHA pins and restricts Actions to those five repositories;
no external reusable workflow is an additional release authority.

The approved workflow configuration has exactly the §§2.55, 2.60 and 2.61 trust and
ordering boundaries. `ci.yml` is read-only on pull requests and `main`;
`release.yml` starts only from a manual dispatch whose captured ref/SHA is the
then-current protected-`main` head, derives rather than accepts the release
identity, and keeps the complete candidate chain in one serialized non-cancelling
`queue: max` run; `maintenance.yml` separates its
read-only health check from its `issues: write` reporter; and
`extended-tests.yml` has no release authority. CI cancels only superseded work
for the same PR/ref, while maintenance and extended testing finish a running
observation and retain only the newest pending run. Every workflow denies token
permissions at its root and grants the minimum named permission per job. The
`release.yml` npm job alone receives
`id-token: write` and the `npm-release` environment; the two manual-handoff jobs
alone add `actions: read` to `contents: read` and use `release-manual` with
`deployment: false`; separate GitHub-release jobs alone receive
`contents: write`. No privileged workflow uses
`pull_request_target`, `workflow_run`, a cross-workflow candidate or a release
cache. The `npm-release` environment admits protected `main`, not `v*` tags; the
canonical tag does not exist when the run begins and is created by the human
only at §2.60's late boundary. No runner polls for that tag or for staged
promotion: §2.61's `release-manual` reviews resume those jobs.

External-fork and Dependabot runs use that same `pull_request` CI without any
secret, OIDC, environment, write permission or privileged follow-on. Their
same-run ephemeral candidate remains quarantined to unprivileged CI jobs and is
never an input to `release.yml`. Governance rejects direct contributor/external
text interpolation into `run:`, arbitrary workflow-command-file output, context
dumps and credential-job tracing, and verifies the §2.59 sanitization and
incident boundary.

The same approved files expose `CI / required` and `Release / qualified` exactly
as §2.58 defines them. Their project-owned mandatory-job inventory is checked by
governance tests, every required matrix uses `fail-fast: false` and no required
failure is neutralized. The npm job depends directly on `Release / qualified`.
Every job and vulnerable step uses the exact timeout class, every permitted read
retry is bounded and classified, and every external write has one automatic
attempt with fail-closed read-only reconciliation of an ambiguous response.

Every required workflow job also has the exact §2.57 host contract. Only
`ubuntu-24.04` x64 produces or publishes release bytes; its Node 22/24 lanes run
the full suite, and the release/browser/WebVOWL/maintenance jobs remain on that
explicit label. `windows-2025` x64 and `macos-15` arm64 each run the focused
installed-tarball suite on both exact Node patches and cannot rebuild the
candidate. Chromium, Firefox and WebKit are separate Ubuntu jobs with one worker
and locally installed matching revisions. Linux/macOS commands select `bash`,
Windows commands select `pwsh`, and each required job emits and validates the
label/OS/architecture/image-version record required by §§2.40 and 2.57. No
`*-latest`, preview/slim/larger/self-hosted runner or container is admitted.
Skipped, cancelled and timed-out lanes remain failures under §2.58 and cannot
contribute qualifying release evidence.

Every checkout disables persisted credentials; only the release source/tag-
verification job checks out the captured `github.sha` and fetches complete
history/tags, and the npm OIDC job performs no checkout. Every
Node setup uses the literal approved patch, disables `check-latest` and
`package-manager-cache`, and supplies no other cache input. Only the temporary
direct-bootstrap branch configures the public npm registry and exposes
`NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` at its publish step; the steady OIDC path contains neither.
The release candidate is the exact three-file §2.56 bundle uploaded with
no-overwrite/hidden-file exclusion/90-day retention and passed by same-run
artefact ID to digest-enforcing downloads that cannot broaden to another
run/repository. No unselected cache/script/publish/release/attestation Action or
local composite wrapper is admitted.

The approved dependency-review Action runs only on pull requests with
`contents: read`, the exact §2.56 vulnerability-only/high/runtime/no-comment/
bounded-snapshot-retry inputs and no PAT. It fails on newly introduced high or
critical runtime findings, while the release workflow retains both §2.34 npm
audit reports and validates every active exception's schema and expiry. The
approved signer-registry gate validates SSH public keys/fingerprints, rejects a
signer introduced by the release pull request itself and excludes the registry
from the package packlist. The approved community configuration keeps Issues
structured, Discussions and blank issues disabled, and does not create
`CODEOWNERS` at this phase.

The approved CodeQL default setup analyzes JavaScript with the default query
suite and the `main` ruleset blocks incomplete analysis and introduced
high/critical findings. It coexists with dependency review rather than replacing
it. Secret scanning and push protection are enabled, the approved exception
schemas are repository-only, and release evidence records the clean/accepted
state without copying sensitive alert contents. Actions logs and workflow
artifacts use the §2.40 90-day diagnostic retention setting but are never the
sole durable evidence for a release.

The approved tooling configuration pins Node `22.23.2` and `24.19.0`, npm
`12.0.2` in `devEngines.packageManager.version` and every workflow setup/gate,
the eight literal §2.54 npm development-tool versions, GitHub CLI `2.98.0` plus
its official binary checksum, and migration-only `git-filter-repo@2.47.0` plus
its recorded upstream tag/commit/retrieval URL/file digest. The import-map
configuration names `jspm.io`, `production`/`browser`/`module` and integrity;
the SBOM configuration names CycloneDX JSON 1.6, reproducible validated library
output and the isolated production-only subject graph; the package lint runs
strictly against tarball bytes; the evidence validator names Draft 2020-12 plus
registered standard formats; and the browser fixture names exact Playwright and
Vite inputs. None of these tools is a runtime dependency.

The approved canonical package manifest **MUST** encode:

```json

}
```

This alpha manifest intentionally omits `funding`, `contributors`, an author
email and any invented maintainer metadata under §2.39. Its `publishConfig.tag`
is `next` because the exact version is a prerelease; Phase 20 changes the field
to `latest` only in an accepted production release pull request and the §2.38 gate
checks the explicit command and requested registry operation against it. The
configuration proposal inserts the §2.45 `devEngines` object with the literal
reviewed npm patch `12.0.2`; the manifest, lockfile, workflows and release
evidence must all agree on that value. It adds no `main`, `module`, `browser`,
`engines.npm` or top-level `packageManager` field. Under §2.48 it also has no
`bundleDependencies`/`bundledDependencies`, `peerDependencies`,
`optionalDependencies` or `overrides`, and the tarball contains neither
`package-lock.json` nor `npm-shrinkwrap.json`.

The owner/repository casing **MUST** remain identical in GitHub, npm metadata,
release evidence and later trusted-publisher configuration. Native ESM exposes
only these public exports:

```text
owlapi            → ./index.js
owlapi/apibinding → public facade for OWLManager/bootstrap
owlapi/model      → public structural/model/manager facade
owlapi/io         → public document-source and I/O-diagnostic facade
owlapi/formats    → public document-format facade
```

The final facade target paths are part of the exact package-manifest approval.
Phase 19 places each public binding's sole canonical definition in the matching
§2.10.4 Java-compatible public namespace; the facade names every binding
explicitly. Private engines move to cohesive `internal/` responsibilities and
are not duplicated under a mirrored Java-shaped internal tree. The facade,
package `exports`, Public API Surface Registry and packed artefact must agree.
The target files are the readable canonical source modules required by §2.23;
there is no `dist/` indirection, generated production tree or source-map layer.

As part of the same repository handoff, create
`docs/compatibility/java-api-surface.json`, generate or mechanically verify
`docs/compatibility/java-api-surface.md`, and move the authoritative capability
matrix to `docs/compatibility/capabilities.json`. The history/path manifest must
account for every public-namespace relocation and every `manager/`, `parser/` or
`rdf/` staging module placed under its final public or private owner. No
semantic behavior is changed merely to complete that relocation.

Prepare the WebVOWL cutover test-first in an isolated candidate checkout. Add a
failing consumer-boundary architecture test at
`src/owlapiConsumerBoundary.architecture.test.js`. It must discover static and
dynamic module specifiers in all WebVOWL source/tests and fail on:

- any retained `src/owlapi-js/` production tree or any relative, absolute or
  repository-root import that resolves to the pre-extraction source;
- any `owlapi/...` specifier other than `owlapi/apibinding`, `owlapi/model`,
  `owlapi/io`, or `owlapi/formats`;
- package metadata, test-helper or other unexported deep imports;
- an `owlapi` resolver alias in Vite or Jest configuration;
- `owlapi` being absent from root `dependencies`, present only in
  `devDependencies`, declared with a range/local/Git specifier, or resolved by
  npm/lockfile to a workspace, filesystem, Git or non-registry source.

Then replace the current reach-ins in
`src/owl2vowl/js/index.js`, `src/owl2vowl/js/importResolver.js` and
`src/owl2vowl/js/vowlBuilder.js`, plus their WebVOWL-side tests, with the
smallest appropriate public specifier. `owlapi/apibinding` supplies
`OWLManager`; `owlapi/model` supplies `IRI`, structural/model values, manager
types and loader configuration; `owlapi/io` supplies `StringDocumentSource`
and I/O diagnostics; and `owlapi/formats` supplies format identities when an
application selects one explicitly. WebVOWL does not import RDF translators or
RDF/JS factory wiring. Tests that currently reach into `model/structural.js`
must construct their fixtures through supported public APIs; an internal helper
is not promoted to a public export merely to make a WebVOWL test convenient.

Before publication, apply those proposed WebVOWL source/manifest changes only
inside the disposable checkout and install the retained candidate tarball with
no save and no lockfile mutation. Jest and Vite must use ordinary Node/package
resolution through `node_modules/owlapi` and the packed package's `exports`
map. The maintained WebVOWL branch and lockfile are changed only after the exact
version is available from the registry; their committed resolution must then be
the registry artefact, never the candidate path.

This consumer gate uses WebVOWL's own accepted lockfile toolchain—Vite `8.1.5`
at the §2.54 decision—not the standalone fixture's `vite@8.2.2`. Do not update
or alias WebVOWL's bundler merely to make the versions match. If WebVOWL has
separately accepted a later version before the gate, record and use that exact
lockfile value instead.

Internal parser paths, package metadata and test helpers are not public
subpath exports. The §2.44 import-purity and tree-shaking tests are release
gates for the required `sideEffects: false`; a failure is corrected rather than
papered over by weakening the manifest. The Node engine floor, release runtime
and alpha browser query **MUST** be exactly those fixed by §§2.19–2.20 and 2.54:
Node `22.23.2` and `24.19.0` are blocking, Node `24.19.0` produces the release,
and alpha uses moving
`baseline widely available`. Phase 19 may not advertise an untested range or
silently turn a non-blocking Node 26 probe into a published support claim.

The runtime dependency list is derived from the production import closure and
must contain every and only directly imported runtime package. Versions remain
governed as required by §6.8 and §21.7. Development/reference dependencies,
Java OWLAPI tooling, OWL2VOWL fixtures, W3C conformance corpora, benchmarks,
WebVOWL, `VOWLBuilder` and release tooling **MUST NOT** enter the installed
runtime dependency graph. All eight exact §2.54 npm release-control tools belong
only in `devDependencies`; neither they nor the reference ESM provider are part of the
installed production closure. The six runtime packages remain ordinary exact
`dependencies` under §2.48, with none recast as a peer, optional or bundled
payload merely to alter consumer resolution.

Create `docs/provenance/third-party-material.json` and its closed §2.47 schema
from the complete production install, release/evidence development toolchain and
copied/generated third-party-file inventory, then inspect the actual declared
licence/notice files and approve every §2.50 relationship, scope and disposition.
The package `NOTICE` is mechanically checked against the tarball-applicable
rows. The record, schema and review evidence remain repository-only; the compact
package notice and §2.47 SBOM are their consumer-facing projections.

##### 17.26.1.1 Runtime portability and package-condition policy

The five approved public exports **MUST** resolve to unconditional native-ESM
targets. Phase 19 **MUST NOT** introduce `node`, `browser` or other
environment-conditioned package `exports`, or a package `imports` field for
platform selection, merely because `owlapi` supports both Node and browsers.
Those package mechanisms are appropriate only when supported environments
genuinely require different module targets; they are not a substitute for a
portable implementation or a narrow environment adapter. This decision follows
the §13 portability rules and Node's distinction between ordinary exports and
[private conditional package imports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-imports).

Where a real platform difference exists, production source **MUST** own it at
the smallest cohesive adapter seam. The adapter must:

1. detect the required capability directly rather than infer a runtime from a
   user agent, `process`, or a `window`/`global` name;
2. prefer the standards-based native capability when it is present;
3. dynamically import a declared production fallback only when the capability
   is absent;
4. keep the fallback and its third-party types behind the private adapter; and
5. throw the applicable typed public error, preserving the cause, if neither
   path is available.

The pre-extraction staging implementation demonstrates the intended shape.
`parser/xml/xmlParserAdapter.js` tests for `globalThis.DOMParser`, uses the
native browser implementation when available, and otherwise lazily imports
`@xmldom/xmldom`. Its adapter tests cover both branches and normalize their
failure semantics. RDF/XML, N3-family and JSON-LD adapters do not maintain
parallel Node/browser implementations: they lazily load one selected
browser-compatible dependency surface (`rdfxml-streaming-parser`,
`n3/browser/n3.min.js`, and `jsonld/dist/jsonld.esm.js`, respectively) that is
also exercised in Node. The portable production graph contains no direct
dependency on Node built-ins, `require`, `__dirname` or `__filename`, and does
not use `process` or `Buffer` as an application-level runtime discriminator.

The XML adapter's staging Vite build deliberately leaves the dormant
`import("@xmldom/xmldom")` expression behind `/* @vite-ignore */` while keeping
the fallback implementation bytes out of the browser bundle. A supported
browser has native `DOMParser`, so it must never evaluate that fallback import.
This is a behavior to verify in installed-package browser tests, not evidence
that a package-level condition is required. Phase 19 **MUST** fail if the Node
fallback implementation enters the browser bundle or if a supported browser
requests or evaluates it during ordinary XML ingestion.

The Q15 decision was informed by the following bounded probe on 23 August 2026.
These are historical staging results and rationale, not substitutes for the
clean-tarball release gates:

| Probe | Observed staging result | What it establishes |
|---|---:|---|
| Focused browser-contract Jest tests for OWL-to-RDF, RDF/XML, Turtle, TriG, N-Triples, N-Quads and JSON-LD | 7 suites and 7 tests passed | The adapters tolerate browser capability contracts and keep Node application globals out of their public behavior. |
| `xmlParserAdapter`, RDF/XML implementation-adapter, N3 implementation-adapter and JSON-LD implementation-adapter tests | 4 suites and 38 tests passed | Native-DOM selection, Node fallback selection, typed failure normalization and the three lazy dependency seams work in Node. |
| Manager-level RDF/XML, Turtle, JSON-LD and OWL/XML tests | 4 suites and 66 tests passed | Representative formats work end to end through `OWLManager`, rather than only through isolated third-party adapters. |
| `npm run build` in WebVOWL | 474 modules transformed; production build passed | Vite resolved the portable graph and emitted separate lazy N3, RDF/XML and JSON-LD chunks without adding tracked build changes. |

The browser-contract Jest tests simulate browser capabilities under Node, and a
successful Vite build proves bundling rather than real-engine execution. Neither
may be described as Chromium, Firefox or WebKit runtime evidence. The
installed-tarball `@playwright/test@1.62.1` suite required by §§17.26.2 and
17.26.4 therefore
remains a mandatory independent gate. It must ingest representative XML and
lazy RDF syntaxes through public `owlapi` specifiers in local Chromium, Firefox
and WebKit, while the Node package suite exercises the fallback branch.

The package-governance test **MUST** assert that the approved public exports
remain direct, unconditional ESM targets and that no environment-conditioned
`exports` or platform-selecting `imports` mapping has appeared. A future
conditional package mapping requires all of the following before adoption:

- a reproducible failure in a supported installed-package runtime or consumer
  build;
- evidence that source-level capability selection cannot correct the failure
  without resolution failure or material dependency leakage;
- an explicit design decision identifying the distinct module targets and
  fallback order; and
- Node, browser-bundle and real-engine tests for every resulting condition.

##### 17.26.1.2 Browser-consumer and environment-status proofs

Implement the §§2.21–2.22 browser contracts against the packed package, not the
canonical source tree. Keep three deliberately distinct consumers under
`test/consumers/browser/` in the canonical repository:

test/consumers/browser/bundler/    ordinary Vite application using public package specifiers
test/consumers/browser/import-map/ native document modules with the generated inline reference map
test/consumers/browser/worker/     Vite-built DedicatedWorker using public package specifiers
```

The package repository installs exact `vite@8.2.2` to build the bundler and
worker fixtures and exact `@playwright/test@1.62.1` to install and drive its
matching Chromium, Firefox and WebKit revisions. Installation and execution use
named npm scripts over those local dependencies; a test command may not download
a different Playwright/Vite package through `npx`, inherit a global binary or
use a Playwright container. Under §2.57, three separate `ubuntu-24.04` jobs each
install only the selected engine and its Linux dependencies without a browser
cache, run one matching project with one worker, and capture the runner image,
package version and actual browser revision.

All three fixtures install the retained tarball as an ordinary dependency. They
must not use a workspace, source alias, repository-relative package import or
unexported path. The import-map fixture additionally uses
`scripts/generate-reference-import-map.mjs` to trace the five public roots and
their static/literal-dynamic production closure with exact
`@jspm/generator@2.16.3` and the §2.46
`jspm.io`/`production`+`browser`+`module`/integrity
configuration. Link the five roots from the unpacked retained tarball and use
the provider only for the browser-loadable external closure. Commit a
human-reviewable version-pinned map example for the current package version,
inject its JSON inline before the first dependent module, and make the
generated-vs-reviewed comparison a package gate. Do not inject
`es-module-shims`. Fail on an unpinned package URL, missing integrity metadata,
an omitted public root, an unresolved lazy import, a CommonJS/UMD execution
leak, or a stale mapping.

Before browser execution, hydrate every referenced provider module, validate
its bytes against the generated integrity metadata and build the ephemeral
local mirror/map required by §2.46 without transforming sources. Run the native
document test against that local mirror in every required engine and separately
verify that the public reference URLs remain retrievable. The mirror is a test
transport artefact, not committed package source or a second supported build.

Write the runtime tests before portability corrections. The initial native-map
test is expected to expose the selected N3 UMD deep path and the CommonJS
RDF/XML implementation boundary. Correct the N3 path to its maintained ESM
artefact if the focused adapter, Node and browser tests prove equivalent. Let the
approved ESM provider perform any reference-consumer CommonJS conversion; do not
check generated third-party bundles into package source or turn them into
public exports. The worker test is expected to expose the Window-only
`DOMParser`/ignored CommonJS fallback seam. Correct that seam behind the private
XML adapter and verify that the fallback remains lazy in ordinary Window builds,
works inside the bundled worker, and preserves the normalized public error
contract in Node and browsers.

Each Playwright engine must then prove:

- all five public package specifiers import with identical binding identities
  where the root re-exports a subpath value;
- the ordinary bundled document loads representative OWL-native, RDF/XML,
  Turtle and JSON-LD documents through `OWLManager`;
- the native import-map document performs the same representative loads without
  a bundler-owned application module graph, using the integrity-verified local
  mirror of the exact public reference-provider graph;
- the bundled dedicated worker loads at least one XML document and one lazy RDF
  document, returns only structured-clone-safe result/evidence values, and emits
  no unresolved bare-specifier, CommonJS-global or missing-`DOMParser` failure;
  and
- no browser path requests the Node XML fallback unless the tested global
  actually lacks the native capability.

Separately, the four blocking §2.57 Windows/macOS × Node lanes install the exact
packed candidate and run their focused public-boundary portability suite. They
do not substitute for any browser project, repeat the complete semantic corpus
or produce another tarball. The README environment table names the three tested
OS/architecture representatives as `SUPPORTED` and leaves other upstream-
supported Node OS/architecture combinations `PLAUSIBLE_UNVERIFIED` rather than
silently generalizing from one Linux job.

Add a package-governance assertion that the README's environment table uses
only the three §2.22 status values and contains every initial matrix row with the
approved status. The test must also reject CommonJS entry metadata, a
turnkey-global build, an environment-conditioned public export, or wording that
promotes Yarn, pnpm, Node 26 Current, workers other than the tested dedicated
worker, or any out-of-scope runtime to `SUPPORTED` without its separately
approved blocking evidence.

Create a package-local README, the complete unmodified GNU AGPLv3 licence text,
all applicable notices, and changelog/release notes consistent with §§2.12–2.27
and the §2.13 rights-inventory/role-separation gate. The initial copyright notice
**MUST** identify Maksym Shostak as owner of his contributions and HADDEN
INDUSTRIES LTD separately as project steward, using the exact linked wording in
§2.13. It **MUST NOT** imply an unexecuted transfer. The README **MUST** include:

- the new-package identity/discontinuity notice required by §2.10;
- the §2.15 “Why `owlapi` exists” rationale, including why the evaluated
  adjacent projects did not satisfy the project's complete requirements;
- installation as `npm install owlapi@next` for the alpha;
- ESM examples using only the five supported specifiers, including paired
  Java/JavaScript manager, document-loading, data-factory, IRI and ontology-
  query examples;
- supported formats, the exact §2.22 environment-status table, capability
  status and known limitations, including npm as the authoritative workflow,
  Yarn/pnpm as `PLAUSIBLE_UNVERIFIED`, CommonJS and the named alternative
  runtimes as `OUT_OF_SCOPE`, and the Node 22/24 distinction between runtime
  compatibility and upstream security maintenance, with the §2.57 tested
  Ubuntu x64/Windows x64/macOS arm64 representatives distinguished from other
  `PLAUSIBLE_UNVERIFIED` Node OS/architecture combinations;
- the §2.11 `alpha.0` capability freeze, including the absence of public
  closure-query/materialization, mutation, merger, save and concrete-storer
  APIs and the resulting lack of `universal-ontology` workflow support;
- the relationship to, and compatibility objective with, Java OWLAPI, including
  a clear statement that this is an independent JavaScript implementation not
  affiliated with or endorsed by the Java OWLAPI project;
- browser and Node usage, including separate bundler, native-document import-map
  and bundled-dedicated-worker examples, the application ownership of import-map
  URLs/CSP/integrity, `jspm.io`'s replaceable reference-provider status, the
  absence of raw-`node_modules`, `es-module-shims`, worker-import-map and IIFE
  guarantees, plus security/network defaults and resource limits;
- links to source, ordinary issue reporting, private security reporting, the
  Code of Conduct, licence, provenance, the detailed alternatives review and
  compatibility data; and
- an accurate `AGPL-3.0-only` statement without suggesting an automatic
  “or-later” option or relicensing separately licensed dependencies.

Create and pack the complete §2.24 version-matched documentation set alongside
the README. Enrich the Public API Surface Registry with the data required by
§2.25, then generate or mechanically check `API.md` so every packed public
binding, Java counterpart, call shape, capability/stability classification,
public error and material semantic qualification is covered exactly once.
Execute its designated examples against the retained tarball. Generate or
verify `docs/compatibility/java-api-surface.md` from the same registry and
capability sources, and fail on disagreement among either human view, the
machine-readable registries, explicit facades, package exports or installed
runtime inventory.

Create a human-curated `CHANGELOG.md` whose prerelease and production entries record
only user-visible package changes, controlled corrections/deviations,
deprecations and compatibility consequences. Do not copy raw commit history or
release-workflow evidence into it. Keep detailed test/provenance evidence in the
canonical repository and immutable release record. Package governance must also
prove that neither the manifest nor tarball advertises or contains official
TypeScript declarations and that the README discloses the §2.26 status without
suggesting that partial or third-party declarations are project-supported.

Phase 19 also creates the canonical
`docs/provenance/npm-package-identity-history.json` evidence record required by
§2.10.1. It records the schema version, observation timestamp, canonical
registry interface, exact probes and results, every known permanently consumed
coordinate, any newly discovered historical coordinate, and the conclusion that
the `0.1.0` line does not satisfy ordinary former 1.x or 2.x ranges. Sanitized
support or registry evidence may be stored alongside the record; credentials,
private source content and personal data may not. Before the alpha and again no
more than seven calendar days before production `0.1.0`, refresh the registry
identity and coordinate evidence and resolve any unexpected conflict. Do not
turn an unbounded public-code search into a claimed proof that no private
consumer exists. The comprehensive exact/range consumer audit is deliberately
deferred to the separately authorized post-zero stability-promotion programme,
where it can inform the real choice of post-zero coordinate.

After its exact repository-policy contents have been approved, create the root
`CONTRIBUTING.md` required by §2.14 and link it from the package README. It must
make the following distinctions conspicuous:

- issue reports, proposals and review do not themselves authorize incorporation
  of contributed expression;
- accepted outside contributions use `AGPL-3.0-only` inbound=outbound and retain
  their contributor's copyright unless a separately approved agreement says
  otherwise;
- the contributor must have authority to grant the applicable rights, including
  any authority required from an employer or other actual owner; and
- the first external copyrightable contribution affecting the package may be
  reviewed but cannot be merged until the §2.14.1 checkpoint records whether
  pure inbound=outbound is retained or a contributor-retained CLA is adopted.

After extraction, extend the canonical repository's `governance.test.js` to
fail if the root contribution policy, package README and package metadata
disagree about the licence, repository identity or project relationship, or if
the contribution policy omits copyright retention, authority-to-submit,
inbound=outbound or the first-external-merge gate. This test verifies published
policy consistency; it is not evidence that a particular person owns a
particular contribution.

After their exact contents receive the repository's required configuration/
policy approval, create the root `SECURITY.md` and enable GitHub private
vulnerability reporting. `SECURITY.md` must implement §2.17 verbatim in
substance: private GitHub reporting first,
`security@haddenindustries.com` second, no public vulnerability reports, the
current supported-version table, a five-working-day acknowledgement target
expressly identified as non-SLA, and the advisory/CVE and integrity-gate policy.
Test the company-controlled role mailbox from an unrelated external provider
before declaring the channel operational. The README links to the canonical
repository policy rather than copying its mutable support table.

Create the root `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` from Contributor Covenant 3.0 with its
required attribution and permanent version URL. Replace every template
placeholder with the actual §2.18 process:
`conduct@haddenindustries.com`, Maksym Shostak as the sole initial HADDEN
INDUSTRIES LTD-appointed moderator, need-to-know handling, non-adjudication when
he is conflicted, honest disclosure that independent handling is post-plan, and
no public/security-channel reports. Verify the address externally and
its single individually authenticated recipient. Keep `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md` and
`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` linked but responsibility-specific; no document may imply
that conduct enforcement decides contribution licensing or that vulnerability
responders automatically receive interpersonal reports.

Extend package governance/packlist tests to assert that the README exposes the
canonical security and conduct policy URLs, the policy files contain the exact
approved role addresses, and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` is absent from the npm
tarball. The test may verify policy shape and links; it must not copy confidential
mailbox membership, report content or private moderation/security records into
the repository.

#### 17.26.2 Deterministic artefact gate

The package is published from an exact reviewed tarball, never directly from an
unreviewed working directory. Before the sequence begins, prepare the exact
version and all version-matched release documentation in a dedicated release
pull request. `npm version 0.1.0-alpha.0 --no-git-tag-version` may be used to
synchronize the manifest and lockfile, but its complete diff is reviewed and
accepted through that pull request. The workflow does not select the version or
write those files. All mandatory matrix work below runs with
`strategy.fail-fast: false`, no allow-failure path and the exact §2.58
job/step timeouts. The release-candidate sequence is:

1. merge the accepted release pull request so every tracked source, policy,
   dependency and workflow input belongs to one curated protected-`main` commit;
   manually dispatch `release.yml` at `main`; reject any dispatch ref other than
   `refs/heads/main`; capture `github.sha` and the then-current `main` head;
   require them to agree; derive the version/tag/channel from reviewed files;
   and prove that neither the canonical `v<version>` tag nor an unexpected public
   coordinate already exists;
2. start from a clean checkout of that exact captured commit, establish and
   verify npm `12.0.2`, run its approved `npm ci`, and verify that no WebVOWL
   checkout/path is needed;
3. run package formatting, lint, architecture, governance, conformance,
   differential, resource and accepted benchmark gates on blocking Node
   `22.23.2` and `24.19.0` on `ubuntu-24.04` x64 as assigned by the approved
   matrix, with the complete release-side gate and packing job on Node
   `24.19.0`; retain the §2.34 full-graph JSON audit and
   blocking production audit against the accepted lockfile, validate every
   active advisory exception, verify the accepted commit's required §2.41 CodeQL
   result and absence/accepted state of source/secret alerts, and record any Node
   26 Current probe separately as non-blocking;
4. run package-specific export, dependency-closure and packlist tests, then run
   `npm pack --dry-run --json` and retain its manifest as pre-tag review
   evidence; prove the public/private production modules are the canonical
   readable source rather than generated `dist/` output, prove all and only the
   §2.24 documents are admitted, prove §2.38 version/channel agreement, the
   exact §2.43 exports-only map and §2.44 import-purity/tree-shaking contract,
   the §2.48 absence of shrinkwrap/bundled/peer/optional/override authority and
   the §2.50 third-party-material/`NOTICE` agreement, and run the §2.42
   installed-package no-network scenarios;
5. on an explicit `ubuntu-24.04` x64 GitHub-hosted runner whose §2.57 image
   identity is recorded, checked out through the exact §2.56
   `actions/checkout@3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1` captured-SHA/full-history/
   no-persisted-credentials policy and exact cache-disabled Node `24.19.0`,
   repeat the required clean install and release gates and build the actual
   tarball exactly once with `npm pack --json`;
6. use the separate §2.47/§2.54 tool and production-only subject workspaces to
   generate and validate the reproducible CycloneDX 1.6 JSON library SBOM with
   exact `@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm@6.0.1`, compare its unflattened/full-PURL
   graph with `npm ls --omit=dev --all --json` from the subject and the packed inventory, then
   generate the exact sorted §2.52 `SHA256SUMS` over only the tarball and SBOM,
   strictly reparse/verify it and record the workflow/tool versions;
7. inspect the tarball itself, not merely the source tree or dry-run output, and
   verify its filename, package identity, byte size, SHA-256 and packlist; run
   local exact `publint@0.3.24` against those tarball bytes in strict
   mode and validate any narrow active exception;
8. install that retained tarball into new lockless, cache-empty temporary
   consumer projects with lifecycle scripts disabled for the inspection
   install, then repeat the supported normal consumer install path; preserve
   the newly resolved lockfile/full production graph, compare it with the
   locked release/SBOM graph under §2.48 and explain every difference;
9. run the public API and Node smoke suites only through `owlapi`,
   `owlapi/apibinding`, `owlapi/model`, `owlapi/io`, and `owlapi/formats`
   imports on Ubuntu, then download and install that same candidate in all four
   blocking §2.57 Windows/macOS × Node portability lanes and require their
   focused public-boundary, representative-load, diagnostics, import-purity and
   no-network checks to pass without rebuilding it;
10. install the same retained tarball into all three §17.26.1.2 exact
   `@playwright/test@1.62.1` consumers, building the package-owned fixtures with
   exact `vite@8.2.2`, and require the bundled document, generated native-document
   import-map over the integrity-verified §2.46 local mirror and bundled
   dedicated-worker public-manager scenarios to pass in three separate
   one-worker `ubuntu-24.04` jobs using locally installed Playwright-managed
   Chromium, Firefox and WebKit without caches or containers, while separately
   verifying the public reference URLs;
11. on `ubuntu-24.04` x64, create an isolated WebVOWL checkout at the recorded source commit, run its
    existing clean install before applying the reviewed consumer-cutover patch,
    install the retained tarball with no save and no lockfile mutation, and run
    the normal WebVOWL Jest suites plus development and production Vite builds;
12. verify in that checkout that the boundary architecture test is green, no
    source package tree/alias/local dependency remains, and the installed
    candidate's identity, version and exports match the tarball;
13. record the §2.16.1 extended-browser/device matrix as `PASS`, `FAIL` or
    reasoned `NOT_RUN`, never as a terminal `INFRASTRUCTURE_ERROR`;
14. archive the exact WebVOWL base commit, candidate-patch digest, commands and
    results so the post-publication WebVOWL commit can be compared with the
    prepublication application trial;
15. run the unprivileged `Release / qualified` aggregate and require every
    mandatory prepublication job above to have concluded `success`; and
16. execute §§2.60–2.61's mode-specific late-tag/manual-handoff boundary without
    rebuilding: for `DIRECT_BOOTSTRAP`, wait at `Release / tag accepted`, have
    the human create/push the canonical signed tag and approve that
    `release-manual` job, verify the tag, create the draft, and only then request
    the direct npm write at `npm-release`; for `OIDC_STAGED`, first stage the
    retained tarball under the separately approved `npm-release` environment,
    require the human's staged-download byte-equality/revalidation evidence,
    then create/push the tag and approve `Release / tag accepted`, verify the tag
    and create the draft, obtain interactive 2FA promotion, and approve
    `Release / publication confirmed` before fresh-registry verification. Attach
    only the exact retained tarball, SBOM and `SHA256SUMS` to the draft and make
    the required and extended test status reviewable in its release notes.

Every job in this sequence uses the §2.57 explicit shell, validates the expected
OS/architecture and contributes its runner/image/runtime record to the §2.40
evidence. It also contributes its §2.58 expected role/applicability,
conclusion, timeout and retry record. No passing result may depend on a
runner-preinstalled Node, npm, browser, package tool or release CLI, and no
skipped, cancelled or timed-out required job is qualifying evidence.

After step 7 and before any downstream consumer/publication job, upload exactly
the tarball, SBOM and `SHA256SUMS` as the run/attempt-qualified §2.56 candidate
bundle. The exact pinned upload Action uses explicit three-file paths,
`if-no-files-found: error`, 90-day retention, compression level zero, no
overwrite, hidden-file exclusion and ordinary archive mode. Export its artefact
ID/digest as job outputs. Every later job downloads only that ID through the
exact pinned download Action with digest mismatch set to error and no name,
pattern, token, repository or run override; rejects extra/missing files; and
rechecks the two file hashes independently. A rerun creates a distinct
attempt-qualified artifact and never overwrites prior diagnostic evidence.

The single manually dispatched `release.yml` run must pass the retained files only between
its own jobs without repacking, use only the exact §2.56 artefact ID path, verify
their SHA-256 values after every artefact upload/download boundary, and enforce
the separate `npm-release` mutation and `release-manual` continuation gates. In
steady state it stops at `npm-release` until the user authorizes the exact pre-tag
stage; in bootstrap it reaches `npm-release` only after tag acceptance and draft
creation. It must then enforce §§2.60–2.61's human tag and public-promotion
boundaries without runner polling. It must not restore a dependency, browser or
build cache, accept a candidate from another workflow or use
`pull_request_target`/`workflow_run` to cross an untrusted-content boundary. A
source,
dependency, metadata, policy or packed-file correction invalidates the candidate
and requires a new reviewed source candidate before the canonical tag exists; if
that correction becomes necessary after tag creation, the version is abandoned
under §2.60. The workflow must not patch a draft release asset in place and
continue.

The workflow has root `permissions: {}` and grants authority only at the job
that needs it. Read-only build/test jobs receive `contents: read`; the protected
npm job receives `contents: read` plus `id-token: write` but never
`contents: write`; the `release-manual` gate/evidence jobs receive only
`contents: read` plus `actions: read`; the separate draft/final GitHub-release jobs receive
`contents: write` but no npm token, npm environment secret or OIDC authority;
and the final fresh verification job returns to `contents: read`. A single
repository-wide `owlapi-release` concurrency group has
`cancel-in-progress: false` and `queue: max`, so a later manual dispatch can
neither cancel a run that may already have created external state nor displace
an older pending release attempt within GitHub's documented 100-run pending
limit. It cannot assume dispatch-order execution and must pass the same fresh
remote-state checks when it starts.

Before exposing that approval, the unprivileged `Release / qualified` aggregate
**MUST** prove that every mandatory pre-publication job concluded `success` and
the workflow **MUST** prove that the SemVer,
`publishConfig.tag`, explicit `--tag` and `npm-release` environment request agree
under §2.38 and that the running npm patch equals §2.45. After the registry
write and fresh-cache checks, it generates, Draft 2020-12/Ajv-validates and
attaches—not source-commits—the §§2.40/2.47 release-evidence asset. Only that
new post-publication evidence asset may be added to the draft; the retained
tarball, SBOM and `SHA256SUMS` remain byte-identical.

The protected-environment pauses are intentionally one-person human gates for
this programme. The initiating named release custodian may approve both
`npm-release` and `release-manual` because prevent-self-review is disabled under
§2.35. The former authorizes only its exact registry mutation; the latter only
acknowledges completed human work and resumes a read-only verification job. Each
approval remains an explicit recorded action after its subject is known;
workflow success never approves itself.

The §2.58 retry and mutation contract applies to the whole sequence. npm and
project-owned download helpers may repeat only their specifically classified
idempotent reads within the approved counts and timeouts. Every npm, GitHub,
issue or Git-ref write receives one automatic attempt. An ambiguous result
stops the chain for exact read-only remote-state/digest reconciliation; only an
already-complete identical operation may resume at verification, while any new
write requires renewed explicit authorization.

The workflow **MUST** compare the tracked tree with the captured dispatch commit
after every
step that can run project or third-party code and fail on any difference. It may
verify or transport the human-authored version, changelog and release notes, but
it **MUST NOT** run a mutating version command, commit, tag, push a source change
or generate unreviewed substitute release notes.

The packed-file allowlist **MUST** admit only the canonical readable production
JavaScript closure, required package metadata and the exact §2.24 documentation
set. The tarball must not contain a duplicate source/distribution tree,
generated JavaScript, minified package code, source maps or TypeScript
declarations. Its manifest must not define an automatic install/pack/publish
lifecycle hook prohibited by §2.23.
The following are forbidden in the tarball and protected by an executable
negative assertion:

```text
*.test.js and test-only helpers/fixtures
WebVOWL or VOWLBuilder code
Java reference harnesses, JARs and generated oracle fixtures
W3C/upstream conformance corpora
benchmarks and local performance output
repository governance/migration internals
package-lock.json and npm-shrinkwrap.json
docs/provenance/third-party-material.json and release/signer/security/lint-exception records
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md and confidential security/conduct records
development configuration and credentials
.phase*-input, deploy output and temporary/cache files
dist/build output, generated/minified production JavaScript and source maps
TypeScript declaration files and TypeScript documentation/build artefacts
```

Consumer verification **MUST** cover at least:

- the isolated WebVOWL candidate application's ordinary test/build workflows
  resolving all core imports through the installed retained tarball and public
  package exports, followed after publication by the same workflows against the
  exact registry dependency;
- an approved public-export/capability snapshot for the §2.11 Phase 18 freeze,
  including negative assertions that follow-on merger, mutation and storer
  features and internal RDF translators/factories have not been nominally
  exposed;
- named exports and binding-identity checks for all five public entry points,
  exact §2.43 target agreement, plus rejection of `main`/`module`/`browser`,
  conditions, patterns, extension aliases, `./package.json`, unexported deep
  imports and `owlapi/rdf`;
- exact agreement among the installed README, `API.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, the
  three shipped compatibility documents, the Public API Surface Registry,
  capability matrix and executable export inventory;
- exact §2.39 description/keywords, omission of `funding`/`contributors`/author
  email/invented maintainer metadata, and §2.38 agreement among version,
  `publishConfig`, authorized command and requested channel;
- exact §2.45 npm-native `devEngines` values, the running approved npm patch and
  absence of `engines.npm` and top-level `packageManager`;
- all six §2.32 packages as exact ordinary `dependencies`, with no package lock,
  shrinkwrap, bundled/peer/optional/override authority or embedded dependency
  payload in the retained tarball;
- preservation and reconciliation of both the repository-locked release/SBOM
  graph and the independent cache-empty lockless consumer graph under §2.48;
- local exact `publint@0.3.24` strict success against the retained tarball and
  validation of any narrowly authorized warning exception;
- exact agreement among the §2.50 production-scoped third-party-material rows,
  production graph, licence evidence, packed `NOTICE` and actual tarball bytes,
  with the development-only rows separately reconciled to the release toolchain;
- execution of the §2.25 public examples from the retained tarball and negative
  proof that no API/documentation example uses a source-tree or internal path;
- absence of `types`/`typings`, `.d.ts` files, duplicate `dist/` code, source
  maps and automatic install/pack/publish hooks;
- one representative OWL-native document and one RDF/XML document through the
  public manager API in blocking Node `22.23.2` and `24.19.0` and in each exact
  `@playwright/test@1.62.1` engine's bundled and native-document-import-map
  consumers;
- lazy Turtle and JSON-LD paths so dynamically loaded runtime dependencies are
  proven present without moving them into the initial browser closure, including
  representative execution in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit through both
  document consumption modes;
- bundled dedicated-worker XML and lazy-RDF ingestion in Chromium, Firefox and
  WebKit, with no implication that document import maps apply to workers;
- exact agreement among `engines`, the alpha browser query, the README's
  §2.22 environment statuses, CI matrix and recorded required/extended results;
- regeneration of the version-pinned reference import map from the retained
  package with the exact §2.46 generator/provider/environment configuration,
  including closure/public-root agreement, complete integrity metadata, public-
  URL verification and the mechanically equivalent local-mirror execution;
- the §2.44 instrumented complete-closure import-purity and production tree-
  shaking proofs, plus no network request during package import, manager
  construction or representative local OWL-native, RDF/XML, Turtle and JSON-LD
  parsing under §2.42;
- production-only dependency installation plus the blocking §2.34 audit, the
  retained full dependency-graph JSON audit and validated active exceptions;
- the exact §2.47/§2.54 separate-workspace, reproducible, validated,
  unflattened/full-PURL CycloneDX 1.6 library SBOM whose dependency graph agrees
  with the installed production subject inventory, lockfile, packed inventory
  and licence/notices, plus Draft 2020-12 validation through exact
  `ajv@8.20.0`/`ajv-formats@3.0.1` of every release/governance record;
- installed size plus initial and lazy browser bundle sizes against the approved
  budgets; and
- absence of any undeclared file-system, Java, WebVOWL or network dependency.

The release candidate **MUST** be committed and pushed to
`Hadden-Industries/owlapi` before the release tag and external publication
authorization. Every tracked source/configuration input used to build the
retained tarball must correspond to that exact reviewed canonical commit. The
generated tarball, SBOM and `SHA256SUMS` are release-workflow outputs and GitHub
release assets, not source commits. Record the canonical commit, signed tag,
original WebVOWL checkpoint/commit map, WebVOWL candidate-patch digest, retained
asset digests, same-run artefact IDs/digests, effective job permissions,
environment/concurrency identity and release-workflow path/blob/run/attempt so
the registry result can be tied back to both source and real-consumer evidence
even though the first package claim
cannot yet use an already-configured npm trusted publisher.

#### 17.26.3 Initial npm publication

Publication is an explicit external-state gate and requires separate approval
for the exact retained tarball digest, publishing custodian, package coordinate,
distribution tag and registry. The protected `npm-release` environment in the
same manually dispatched `release.yml` run is the npm-write approval boundary.
Before reaching it, a read-only Node `24.19.0` preflight job downloads the exact §2.56
same-run artefact ID, records Node `24.19.0`/npm `12.0.2`, rejects any other
value, verifies the captured dispatch commit and initial canonical-tag absence,
`SHA256SUMS`, configured public registry and package name/version, and runs the
final dry-run without registry credentials. `Release / tag accepted` then waits
at `release-manual` without a runner. The human creates and pushes the signed
`v0.1.0-alpha.0` tag at that exact commit and approves that waiting job; once
started, it verifies the target/signature/authorized signer/GitHub result and
review history. The separate release-write job creates and checks the draft
assets before the later `npm-release` job requests npm authority.
No organization-labelled or shared login may stand in for the authorized
`maksymshostak` bootstrap identity. The `maksymshostak` workflow initiator may
also provide both explicit environment approvals; no second-person approval is
implied.

For the initial package claim, create the one-day npm granular access token in
the npm web interface with write access and bypass-2FA enabled, and select only
`owlapi` if npm permits selecting the not-yet-created coordinate. If npm does
not, record the temporary all-packages write scope explicitly and require a new
approval of that real effective authority; do not misrepresent the token as
package-scoped. Store it only as the protected `npm-release` environment's
Actions secret; `release-manual` remains empty.
The publication job has only `contents: read` and `id-token: write`; it never
receives `contents: write` or checks out source. The temporary bootstrap branch
uses exact cache-disabled `actions/setup-node` with
`registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org/`, then exposes the secret as
`NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` only to the exact publish step. The earlier non-mutating
preflight runs against the retained tarball as:

```text
npm publish owlapi-0.1.0-alpha.0.tgz --dry-run --provenance --tag next --access public --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

After its output matches the reviewed pack manifest, the signed-tag gate and
draft pass, and `npm-release` has been separately approved, the GitHub-hosted release job uses
the identical artefact-ID-downloaded retained tarball and options without
`--dry-run`:

```text
npm publish owlapi-0.1.0-alpha.0.tgz --provenance --tag next --access public --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

Do not publish the directory, rebuild the tarball, omit `--tag next`, set
`latest`, publish from a developer workstation, or try a succession of alternate
versions. No authentication token or OTP is written into commands retained in
repository evidence, and untrusted pull-request code must never run in a job
that can access the publication environment. The workflow's bootstrap branch
must also reject every coordinate except an as-yet-absent
`owlapi@0.1.0-alpha.0`. Immediately after the single
authorized publish attempt, revoke the granular access token in npm and remove
the `npm-release` environment secret; the one-day expiration is not a substitute.
An ambiguous response is first reconciled through read-only registry queries
against the exact coordinate, integrity, provenance and retained digest. If an
identical public result already exists, continue only with verification; if the
coordinate is absent, partial, conflicting or unprovable, fail closed. Any
genuinely new publish attempt requires a newly created token, renewed exact
approval and a fresh digest/coordinate check.

The outcome branches are normative:

- **Success:** keep `owlapi@0.1.0-alpha.0` public under `next`; do not unpublish
  it as a probe and do not assign it to `latest`.
- **Authentication/2FA failure:** correct the account/session control and make a
  new attempt at the same reviewed coordinate only after reconfirming the
  artefact digest and obtaining renewed explicit authorization.
- **Manifest/tarball/workflow failure before canonical-tag creation:** no draft
  or tag exists; return to the release gate, make the reviewable correction and
  create a new source candidate at the same still-unused version after fresh tag/
  registry checks; do not mutate retained assets or weaken validation.
- **Deterministic correction required after canonical-tag creation but before a
  successful registry write:** leave the tag untouched, keep any draft
  unpublished while preserving its failed-attempt meaning, record and abandon
  `0.1.0-alpha.0` under §2.60, and prepare
  `0.1.0-alpha.1`; never move the tag or publish known-defective bytes.
- **Namespace/permission failure after successful authentication:** preserve
  sanitized evidence and contact npm Support before changing the public name.
- **Version conflict:** investigate previously undiscovered immutable registry
  history; do not increment candidate versions until the conflict is explained
  and the plan is amended if necessary.

If a defect is discovered only after a successful registry write, preserve that
published version and execute §2.33. For the initial alpha, remove `next` when no
known-good prerelease exists, deprecate the defective coordinate when public
wording is safe, and prepare a new prerelease version through the full gate. Do
not use unpublish as routine rollback or mutate the draft/immutable artefact to
pretend the original write did not occur.

#### 17.26.4 Post-publication verification, WebVOWL cutover and custody

Registry success text alone does not close the phase. From a fresh npm cache and
consumer directory, verify all of the following against the public registry:

```text
npm metadata exposes exactly owlapi@0.1.0-alpha.0
the next tag points exactly to 0.1.0-alpha.0
no latest tag exists
npm install owlapi@next installs the expected public dependency closure
the fresh lockless consumer graph is recorded and every difference from the locked release/SBOM graph is explained
the registry integrity/tarball content agrees with the retained artefact
the exact root owlapi coordinate passes npm registry-signature, provenance, publish-attestation, subject, repository, tag/commit/workflow and transparency validation
the installed manifest has the exact description/keywords, the deliberately omitted metadata fields are absent, and publishConfig.tag=next
the installed manifest has only the exact unconditional exports map, sideEffects=false and the approved devEngines npm patch, with no forbidden fallback/package-manager fields
the manifest/tarball has no shrinkwrap, bundled, peer, optional or override dependency authority and no package lock
all five public import specifiers pass the installed-package smoke suite
the installed files are canonical readable source plus exactly the approved documentation set
API.md and the compatibility registries agree with the executable public inventory
local publint@0.3.24 passes the registry-downloaded tarball in strict mode
the production-scoped third-party-material inventory, production graph, SBOM and tarball NOTICE agree
no dist/generated/minified/source-map/TypeScript-declaration or automatic lifecycle surface exists
Node 22.23.2 and Node 24.19.0 with npm 12.0.2 pass the full Ubuntu suite and all four blocking Windows/macOS installed-package lanes
the @jspm/generator@2.16.3 reference map has complete integrity metadata, its public URLs verify, and its local mirror passes
the three one-worker ubuntu-24.04 @playwright/test@1.62.1 Chromium/Firefox/WebKit jobs pass the vite@8.2.2 bundled and dedicated-worker fixtures
every required job's requested label, OS/architecture, runner-image version, shell and actual runtime identity is recorded and valid under §2.57
CI / required and Release / qualified inventories agree with governance and every applicable mandatory conclusion is success
required matrices used fail-fast=false with no effective continue-on-error, swallowed status or neutralized report
every job/critical step used its §2.58 timeout and every workflow used its approved concurrency/cancellation/queue mode
controlled-read retries and every external-mutation attempt/reconciliation are recorded, with no skipped/cancelled/timed-out prerequisite reaching publication authority
the complete package-owned production closure is import-pure, its tree-shaking fixture passes, and package import, manager creation and local parsing produce no outbound request
the @cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm@6.0.1 tool/subject workspaces and graph reconciliation pass
every Draft 2020-12 release record passes ajv@8.20.0 plus ajv-formats@3.0.1 validation
bare npm install owlapi does not silently select the prerelease
```

Re-download the registry tarball without relying on the release workflow's npm
cache, compare its SHA-256 with `SHA256SUMS`, regenerate/compare the production
dependency inventory against the retained §2.47 CycloneDX 1.6 SBOM, and rerun
the strict §2.49 tarball lint, §2.50 material/notice reconciliation and exact
§2.51 npm signature/attestation validation. Preserve and compare the fresh
lockless consumer graph under §2.48, then rerun the required Ubuntu Node 22/24,
four Windows/macOS portability, three Ubuntu Chromium/Firefox/WebKit, import-map
document, dedicated-worker and isolated WebVOWL checks against the registry
installation.
Registry success text or matching metadata alone is insufficient.

After those checks pass, generate
`owlapi-0.1.0-alpha.0.release-evidence.json` from the verified workflow state,
validate it with the exact §2.47 Ajv/Draft 2020-12 toolchain against the §2.40
schema, attach it to the draft and verify its recorded
tarball/SBOM/checksum/tool identities. Then publish the draft GitHub release
with release immutability enabled. Verify that GitHub reports the release as
immutable and that its automatic release attestation covers the signed
tag/commit and all four retained assets: tarball, SBOM, `SHA256SUMS` and release
evidence. Do not add a redundant manual artifact attestation for the same
subjects. In a fresh job, perform every exact §2.52 release, per-asset,
checksum, schema and signed-tag verification before recording the immutable
release as accepted. The release notes preserve the required results and the
`PASS`/`FAIL`/`NOT_RUN` extended-test matrix as of that moment; later
non-blocking executions add dated append-only repository evidence as required
by §§2.16.1 and 2.40.

Inspect the public npm page for correct README rendering, the exact
`AGPL-3.0-only` licence identity, canonical repository, issue URL, maintainers,
identity-discontinuity notice, independent-Java-OWLAPI relationship statement
and §2.15 rationale, plus the exact §2.39 description/keywords and §2.42
zero-telemetry statement. Confirm the deliberately omitted manifest fields are
absent and the §§2.43–2.45 exports/import-purity/development-tool metadata is
exact, then confirm the §§2.48–2.51 dependency-shape, strict-lint,
third-party-material and root-provenance results. From the installed registry
tarball also inspect `API.md`,
`CHANGELOG.md`, `NOTICE` and all three compatibility documents for the exact
§§2.24–2.26 contents and links. Record the publication
timestamp, npm/Node versions, publishing custodian, source commit, release tag,
tarball URL, registry integrity, npm provenance, GitHub release-attestation
verification and all verification commands/results in the canonical
repository's append-only
`docs/provenance/releases/0.1.0-alpha.0/release.json`. That record includes the
immutable evidence-asset digest and release/attestation URLs and remains outside
the npm tarball. The already-pushed signed `v0.1.0-alpha.0` tag must still
resolve to the exact release source commit.

After registry verification and the exact WebVOWL configuration approval, apply
the reviewed consumer-cutover patch to the maintained WebVOWL branch, remove the
frozen `src/owlapi-js/` staging tree and any transferred package-only working-
tree documentation/tooling, and install `owlapi@0.1.0-alpha.0` with exact-save
semantics from the public registry. The committed WebVOWL lockfile must contain
the registry tarball URL/integrity and no workspace, local tarball, filesystem,
Git or link resolution. Compare the final diff with the recorded candidate patch
apart from the deliberately post-publication registry lockfile and source-tree
deletion, then repeat the boundary, Jest and development/production build gates.
Commit and push that WebVOWL consumer checkpoint only with their separately
required authorizations.

The same cutover includes a direct-dependency ownership audit of WebVOWL's root
manifest. For each of `@rdfjs/data-model`, `@rdfjs/dataset`,
`@xmldom/xmldom`, `jsonld`, `n3`, and `rdfxml-streaming-parser`, prove whether a
retained WebVOWL production module or build responsibility imports it after the
package staging tree is removed. Remove every dependency used only by
`owlapi`; retain a dependency only with a recorded WebVOWL-owned consumer.
Present the exact `package.json` removals and resulting lockfile change for the
repository's required configuration approval before applying them. A clean
install, production-dependency inventory, Jest run, and development/production
Vite builds must remain green after the cleanup.

As part of that production build, create or update WebVOWL's own deployment-
scope third-party inventory from the exact emitted bundle/asset graph. Reconcile
it with WebVOWL's registry-backed lockfile and preserve all notices applicable to
code physically redistributed by the application. The §2.50 `owlapi` tarball
record is an input to this review, not a substitute for it; package-external
dependencies may become embedded application code only at this later bundling
boundary.

After npm package access exists, require 2FA for package changes and perform the
§2.28 empirical organization-team test: attempt to give the dedicated
`@hadden-industries:owlapi-maintainers` team read-write access, verify effective
access through registry state and a non-publication permission check, and retain
the exact sanitized result. Use the team if npm supports it, but do not describe
the npm organization or company as coordinate owner if the effective registry
state does not establish that relationship. Maksym Shostak remains the only
natural-person npm and GitHub custodian required through this plan; record that
the organization/team test does not create human redundancy or an independently
tested recovery path. A shared generic npm identity is prohibited.

After the alpha and immutable-release checks pass, accept the reviewed
configuration change that removes the bootstrap-token branch/reference from
`.github/workflows/release.yml`; its path remains stable. Configure a GitHub
Actions OIDC trusted publisher for subsequent releases from the exact
case-sensitive `Hadden-Industries/owlapi` repository,
`.github/workflows/release.yml` path and `npm-release` protected environment.
Require `id-token: write` only in its publication job, use a GitHub-hosted
runner and a supported Node/npm publication toolchain, and verify automatic public
provenance. Grant that publisher only stage authority, disallow traditional
token publication, remove the already-revoked bootstrap secret, and require the
complete §2.53 `stage view`/`stage download`/SHA-256/revalidation/interactive-2FA
approval path. The OIDC staging command omits `--provenance` because trusted
publishing supplies it automatically. Do not retain a redundant
`actions/attest` step. Have Maksym Shostak rehearse and record the recovery and
release procedures against the real configured identities. Verify that
`security@haddenindustries.com` and `conduct@haddenindustries.com` are delivered
only to his individually authenticated, MFA-protected access for this plan,
without publishing private recipient details. The evidence explicitly records
that no independent substitute custodian, security responder or ordinary conduct
moderator is required before completion. These operational controls neither
transfer copyright nor depend on a copyright assignment, and they must not alter
the retained first-release artefact.

That accepted configuration change also removes every temporary
`registry-url`, `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` and bootstrap-secret reference. The surviving
steady-state publication job performs no checkout, gives the exact §2.56
`actions/setup-node` invocation neither registry nor cache configuration, and
obtains npm authority only through the `npm-release` environment's short-lived OIDC
exchange. A dead bootstrap input, dormant secret lookup or setup-node-generated
`.npmrc` is a release-blocking credential path, not harmless historical
scaffolding.

Phase 19 completes only when the public install and package-content gates are
green, the §2.19 Node matrix and both §2.21 document modes plus the bundled
dedicated-worker matrix are green, the README/environment-status and generated
reference-map checks agree with §§2.20–2.22, the direct-readable-source,
bounded-documentation, mechanically governed API and no-TypeScript gates agree
with §§2.23–2.26, the exact dependency and update-policy controls agree with
§2.32, the `main` and `v*` rulesets and squash-only merge policy agree with
§2.30, the release pull request and non-mutating workflow agree with §2.31, the
full/production audit evidence and any unexpired exceptions agree with §2.34,
the explicit self-approvable human release gate agrees with §2.35, the SSH tag
and signer registry agree with §2.36, the structured issue/PR intake and absent
Discussions/blank issues/`CODEOWNERS` agree with §2.37, release-channel metadata
agrees with §2.38, npm discovery metadata agrees with §2.39, durable evidence
and 90-day diagnostic retention agree with §2.40, CodeQL/secret protection and
any unexpired source exceptions agree with §2.41, the no-telemetry/network test
and README promise agree with §2.42, the sole exact exports map agrees with
§2.43, complete-closure import purity/tree shaking and `sideEffects: false`
agree with §2.44, the literal npm `devEngines`/workflow version and forbidden-
field checks agree with §2.45, reference-map generation/public-URL verification/
local-mirror execution agree with §2.46, the CycloneDX 1.6 production graph and
Draft 2020-12/Ajv evidence validation agree with §2.47, and the release evidence
records both locked and lockless graphs and the read-only monitor agrees with
§2.48, strict retained/registry tarball lint and any narrow exception agree with
§2.49, the reviewed material inventory/package notice/WebVOWL distribution
review agree with §2.50, exact root npm signature/attestation validation agrees
with §2.51, the checksum plus fresh immutable-release/per-asset/tag checks agree
with §2.52, steady-state publisher configuration plus staged-candidate
download/digest/review procedures agree with §2.53, the exact local/external
tool versions plus SBOM-workspace isolation agree with §2.54, and the four
workflow triggers, same-run candidate chain, least-privilege job separation,
protected environment, non-cancelling release concurrency and Action controls
agree with §2.55, and the exact five-Action tag/SHA inventory, checkout and
setup-node inputs, cache/credential exclusions, artefact-ID transfer and narrow
dependency-review policy agree with §2.56, and the explicit GA host labels,
authoritative Ubuntu release construction, four blocking portability lanes,
three Ubuntu browser jobs, shell policy and per-job image records agree with
§2.57, and the exact aggregate checks, fail-fast/allow-failure policy,
concurrency queues, timeouts, controlled read retries, one-attempt mutation and
ambiguous-result reconciliation evidence agree with §2.58, and the all-external
per-run approval, no-secret/no-write fork/Dependabot execution, same-run
artefact quarantine, untrusted-data/workflow-command validation, sensitive-log/
debug restrictions and incident evidence agree with §2.59, and the protected-
`main` manual dispatch, pre-tag deterministic/staged-byte gates, later signed-tag
verification, failed-attempt record and immutable-tag abandonment policy agree
with §2.60, and the exact no-authority `release-manual` configuration, one-gate
bootstrap/two-gate staged graph, authenticated review history, no-polling rule
and reconciliation behavior agree with §2.61; the compatibility/provenance
records are committed,
the GitHub release is immutable and its tag/assets verify, the root security and
conduct policies expose the tested `security@haddenindustries.com` and
`conduct@haddenindustries.com` channels with their approved separation,
the §2.13 rights inventory and owner/author/steward metadata agree with the
retained tarball, the §2.28 organization-team experiment is recorded, and the
actual sole-custodian `MaksymShostak`/`maksymshostak` authority is verified and
accurately disclosed without a shared npm login or false redundancy claim,
the approved §2.14 inbound=outbound contribution policy and executable
policy-consistency gate are present, the release evidence confirms no unresolved
external copyrightable contribution in the reviewed alpha scope, the history
partition/commit-map/hash evidence is complete, the independent repository is
the only maintained package source, and WebVOWL consumes the exact public
registry alpha—normally `0.1.0-alpha.0`, or solely after §2.60 abandonment its
successor—only through the applicable declared `owlapi`,
`owlapi/apibinding`, `owlapi/model`, `owlapi/io`, and `owlapi/formats`
specifiers. No relative source-tree import, `owlapi/rdf`, unexported deep
import, workspace/local/Git dependency, copied package tree, package-only
WebVOWL dependency, or resolver alias may remain.
If npm namespace control remains unresolved, the phase is blocked rather than
renamed or reported complete. Pause at this gate for the requested Git
checkpoint. Promotion to the normal production `owlapi@0.1.0` target is a later separately approved
release gate; the alpha **MUST NOT** be converted into a production release merely
by moving its distribution tag to `latest`.

### 17.27 Phase 20 — qualify and publish production-recommended `owlapi@0.1.0`

Phase 20 begins only after Phase 19 has published and verified the accepted
alpha—normally `owlapi@0.1.0-alpha.0`, or solely after §2.60 abandonment its next
prerelease—and WebVOWL consumes that exact public-registry package; the Phase 19
checkpoint must also have been committed and pushed. It runs release work in
`Hadden-Industries/owlapi` and consumer verification in
`Hadden-Industries/webvowl`.

This is a productionization and release phase. It does not implement the
imports-closure query, mutation, merger, save, Functional Syntax storer, or
RDF/XML storer capabilities formerly assigned to this phase. Those features are
owned by `ontology-lifecycle-capability-implementation-plan.md` and target a later
compatible feature release.

W3C test-suite result completion, EARL generation, upstream eligibility
consultation, and implementation-report submission are likewise owned by
`w3c-test-conformance-reporting-implementation-plan.md`. That programme starts
only after this plan completes. No W3C reply, submission, merge, or report
publication is a Phase 20 or accepted-production acceptance criterion.

Allowed changes between the accepted alpha and production release are limited to:

```text
test-proven defects in an already declared capability
security or finite-resource corrections
supported-environment portability corrections
diagnostic and error-contract corrections
public-facade, package, documentation, provenance, or release-process defects
```

A new parser, ontology-operation family, storer, public workflow, direct RDF
translator/factory API, or speculative compatibility type is a feature and
cannot enter the `0.1.0` production target or its §2.60 same-surface successor. A discovered requirement for one of those capabilities
moves to the follow-on plan; it does not silently expand this phase.

#### 17.27.1 Freeze and verify the production 0.1 public contract

Turn §2.10.4 into executable release evidence before preparing a production
candidate:

1. regenerate the pinned Java package/type inventory, reconcile every row and
   prove the Public API Surface Registry has zero unclassified Java public
   types;
2. enumerate every binding exported from `owlapi`, `owlapi/apibinding`,
   `owlapi/model`, `owlapi/io`, and `owlapi/formats` and reconcile that set
   exactly with the registry and package `exports`;
3. classify each binding's capability status, progress, exposure, relationship
   and compatibility while recording its exact Java authority or approved
   JavaScript adaptation, canonical source module, intentional omissions and
   verification; classify every accepted production public binding as `INITIAL_DEVELOPMENT`,
   every retained deprecated binding as `DEPRECATED_INITIAL_DEVELOPMENT`, and private values as
   `INTERNAL_ONLY` under §2.27;
4. classify direct RDF translators, RDF/JS factories, graph policy, parser
   adapters, registries, test helpers and implementation engines as
   `INTERNAL_ONLY`, and prove none is duplicated as a nominal public binding;
5. prove every public binding has one canonical definition in its Java-shaped
   public namespace while private engines use cohesive, non-mirrored
   `internal/` ownership;
6. replace unrestricted public `export *` chains with explicit named facades
   and prove root/subpath re-exports of the same value have identical binding
   identity;
7. execute paired Java/JavaScript examples for manager creation, document
   loading, data-factory access, IRI creation and ontology queries;
8. regenerate or verify the human-readable Java compatibility/gap view and
   `API.md`, then prove both agree with the registry, capability matrix and
   executable export inventory; and
9. prove `owlapi/rdf`, wildcard paths, package metadata, syntax-specific parser
   paths and all other unexported deep imports fail.

The README and API reference use this exact compatibility statement: the
package is a JavaScript-native, behaviourally compatible subset of Java OWLAPI
for its declared capabilities. They do not claim Java source, binary, or
complete-surface compatibility and do not imply affiliation or endorsement.
The production registry and `API.md` also identify the exact §2.27 protected and
non-contract surfaces. A deprecation test must prove that a `DEPRECATED_INITIAL_DEVELOPMENT`
binding remains operational through its public path, names its replacement and
does not emit an unsolicited runtime warning.

##### 17.27.1.1 Freeze and reconcile the production environment contract

On the accepted production 0.1.x release-freeze date, replace the alpha manifest's moving
`baseline widely available` value with the §2.20 dated query containing that
actual UTC date. Commit the query, resolved browser/version set, resolver/data
versions and generation command before creating `0.1.0-rc.0`. Add an executable
ceiling check that scans the complete static and lazy production closure and
fails if package source or a selected browser entry requires a feature newer
than the freeze. Do not satisfy the check by adding package transpilation or a
polyfill.

Keep `engines.node` exactly `^22.0.0 || ^24.0.0`, keep Node 22 and 24 blocking,
and keep the release job on Node 24. Retain the exact §2.57 host topology:
full-suite/release construction on `ubuntu-24.04` x64, candidate qualification on
both Node patches across `windows-2025` x64 and `macos-15` arm64, and no moving,
preview, self-hosted or container runner. If Node 26 has become LTS by this gate,
present the exact manifest/CI expansion for separate configuration approval and
make it blocking only after all package, retained-tarball and WebVOWL-consumer
gates pass; otherwise retain it only as a disclosed non-blocking Current probe.

Regenerate the native-document reference import map for the release-candidate
coordinate with the unchanged exact §2.46 generator/provider/environment/
integrity configuration, rehydrate and verify the provider closure, and rerun
all three §17.26.1.2 browser consumers—including the local mirror—in Chromium,
Firefox and WebKit as separate one-worker `ubuntu-24.04` jobs, and rerun the four
blocking installed-tarball portability lanes. Reconcile the observed matrix with the README's exact
`SUPPORTED`, `PLAUSIBLE_UNVERIFIED` and `OUT_OF_SCOPE` rows. Production publication
is blocked by an unsupported feature in a claimed environment, a stale or
unpinned reference map, a failed supported document mode, or a failed bundled
dedicated-worker scenario; it is not blocked merely because an explicitly
unverified/out-of-scope runtime has no result.

#### 17.27.2 Stabilize the accepted capability surface

Run the complete package suite and the exact public-registry WebVOWL consumer
suite against the alpha. Each failure is handled test-first:

1. preserve the minimal failing ontology, environment, public call, and
   observed result;
2. prove the regression fails against the packed/installed package boundary;
3. implement the smallest correction without adding a capability family;
4. rerun focused, Java differential or standards conformance, full package,
   resource/security, and WebVOWL consumer gates as applicable; and
5. update expected differences, provenance, compatibility documentation, and
   `CHANGELOG.md`/release notes only when the correction changes an observable
   result or controlled deviation, and classify its §2.27 SemVer consequence
   before accepting it.

Representative RDF/XML, Turtle, OWL/XML, Functional Syntax, Manchester, DL,
KRSS1, KRSS2, N-Triples, N-Quads, TriG, and JSON-LD loads remain green through
the manager API. The production WebVOWL corpus, imports loading, VOWL output,
development server build, and production build remain green through installed
package specifiers only. The Node `22.23.2`/`24.19.0` matrix and bundled-document,
native-document-import-map and bundled-dedicated-worker browser consumers, plus
the §2.57 Windows/macOS installed-tarball lanes, remain green under the production
environment contract; a portability correction must not
silently narrow a syntax to only one consumption mode.

#### 17.27.3 Complete the production-version safety gates

No more than seven calendar days before the production publication attempt,
refresh and retain the package-identity and immutable-coordinate evidence in
§2.10.1. Confirm that no newly discovered historical coordinate conflicts with
`0.1.0` and that ordinary former 1.x and 2.x ranges still cannot select this 0.x
line. An unexpected coordinate conflict blocks this phase for a separately
approved version decision. The comprehensive historical exact/range consumer
audit remains deferred to a future post-zero stability-promotion programme.

Reconfirm the rights inventory, owner/author/steward role attribution,
contribution-rights, dependency licence/notice, security, package-custody,
repository-policy, trusted-publication, provenance, and recovery controls
required by §§2.10–2.18 and §§2.28–2.61. A control previously verified
for the alpha is rechecked where its state can change; evidence is referenced
rather than duplicated where it is immutable.

Regenerate the §2.34 full dependency-graph audit and blocking production audit
from the exact production-candidate lockfile. Revalidate the reachability, owner and
expiry of every active advisory exception; reject expired, silent-renewal or
schema-invalid entries. A required audit endpoint that has not produced a valid
result blocks the release rather than becoming extended `NOT_RUN` evidence.

Require the accepted production-candidate commit's §2.41 CodeQL result, reject any
unresolved high/critical source or secret alert, and revalidate every active
code-scanning exception independently from dependency advisories. Re-run the
§2.42 installed-package no-network scenarios against the exact candidate
tarball; a new transitive request is a release-blocking regression.

Re-run the exact §§2.43–2.61 gates against the production candidate: the sole
exports map and negative paths, complete-closure import purity and production
tree shaking, literal npm `devEngines`/workflow version, JSPM reference/public-
URL/local-mirror checks, CycloneDX production graph and every Draft 2020-12/Ajv
evidence validation, locked/lockless dependency resolution, strict tarball lint,
third-party-material/distribution notices, exact npm root attestation,
checksum/immutable-release tooling and the manually dispatched, late-tag,
same-run least-privilege workflow boundary, including the currently approved Action SHAs and exact
security-relevant inputs, runner labels/architectures, shell allocation and
per-job image evidence, both aggregate dependency inventories/results,
`fail-fast: false` required matrices, exact concurrency queues and timeouts,
controlled-read retry records, and single-attempt mutation/reconciliation
evidence, plus the external-fork approval/no-secret boundary, quarantined
same-run CI artefact flow, validated workflow input/output and sanitized
credential-job logging contract. Production publication cannot inherit an alpha
result for candidate bytes or mutable tooling/provider/registry state.

Audit WebVOWL's direct dependencies after the source-tree extraction. Every
package used only by `owlapi` is absent from WebVOWL's manifest and lockfile;
every retained dependency has a WebVOWL-owned production or build consumer.
Repeat the clean production-dependency inventory, Jest, development-build, and
production-build gates after the exact approved cleanup.

#### 17.27.4 Publish and verify a `0.1.0` release candidate

Prepare `0.1.0-rc.0` as the first production-line candidate under the approved
prerelease policy. If a candidate fails, correct the defect and increment only
the prerelease component (`0.1.0-rc.1`, and so on); do not burn production or
historical coordinates. Each candidate is prepared in its own §2.31 release
pull request; its version, changelog, compatibility/evidence set and package
metadata are reviewed before the accepted protected-`main` commit is manually
dispatched through §§2.60–2.61. Its `publishConfig.tag` and explicit authorized
`npm stage publish --tag next` command both name `next` under §2.38, while its
§2.39 description/keywords and omitted metadata remain unchanged. The release
workflow derives the expected tag, fully qualifies and stages the candidate,
and only after staged-byte review permits the human to create the SSH-signed
annotated tag and approve `Release / tag accepted`; it then verifies the pre-authorized signer, captured target commit
and GitHub verification result and transports that state without modifying it.

Apply the Phase 19 deterministic-artefact gate to the candidate: clean canonical
clone, deterministic install, full tests, production dependency audit,
packlist inspection, one retained tarball, the exact §2.47 validated
reproducible CycloneDX 1.6 production-only library SBOM, `SHA256SUMS`, required
§2.46 Chromium/Firefox/WebKit installed-package checks, clean Node consumers,
§2.48 locked/lockless inventories, strict §2.49 tarball lint, §2.50 material/
notice review, post-registry §2.51 root-attestation validation, exact §2.52
immutable-release verification, §2.53 staged-candidate binding and an isolated
WebVOWL candidate installation, with the exact §2.57 Ubuntu construction,
Windows/macOS qualification and browser-host topology. Report every extended browser/device result
under §2.16.1.

The same §2.58 failure contract is re-evaluated for every release candidate and production
candidate. `Release / qualified` must succeed before npm authority is exposed;
every required matrix finishes without allow-failure; and every timeout remains
a blocking failure. Stage creation and stage approval each receive one
automatic attempt. Each `release-manual` gate has no mutation attempt and only
starts after its explicit review. An ambiguous response is reconciled read-only against the
exact stage/coordinate/digest, and a new stage or approval write requires
renewed explicit authorization rather than a blind retry.

After the deterministic pre-tag gates and separate `npm-release` environment
authorization pass, run the exact
§2.53 command against the retained `owlapi-0.1.0-rc.N.tgz` with `--tag next`,
record its stage ID and stop. An interactively authenticated maintainer then
runs `npm stage view` and `npm stage download`, verifies the fixed `next` tag and
all candidate metadata, proves that the staged tarball's SHA-256 exactly equals
the retained digest and reruns the required tarball checks. Reject any mismatch
before a canonical tag exists. Only after that review may the human create and
push the candidate's signed annotated tag at the captured commit and approve the
waiting `Release / tag accepted` job. The same run must verify the tag/review
history and populate the draft GitHub release. Bind the stage review and tag
result to the source commit. Only then may the passing candidate receive
`npm stage approve <stage-id>` with 2FA; after that command completes, the human
approves `Release / publication confirmed`. Never create or move `latest` for a
release candidate. Once that read-only job starts, repeat all checks from a fresh registry
cache and publish the draft GitHub release as immutable only after registry
verification. Record the `next` tag's exact before/after values as part of the
separately authorized registry operation. The initiating named release
custodian may provide the explicit `npm-release`/`release-manual` approvals and
npm proof-of-presence approval under §2.35; a second-person approval is not required.

Before making that release immutable, generate and attach its §2.40
`owlapi-0.1.0-rc.N.release-evidence.json`, validate it against the observed
registry state and the §2.47 Draft 2020-12 schema with the exact Ajv toolchain,
include the §§2.48–2.61 graph/lint/material/provenance, staged-candidate/manual-handoff,
toolchain, workflow and release-verification identities, and preserve the repository post-release
record. A later extended
test adds a dated repository observation; it does not alter the release assets.

Update an isolated WebVOWL checkout to the exact public release-candidate
version and run the ordinary Jest, development Vite, and production Vite
workflows plus representative production RDF/XML and imports-aware workloads.
No local package, tarball, workspace, Git dependency, source alias, or
unexported path may participate. Preserve the candidate source commit, tag,
tarball digest, registry integrity, WebVOWL patch digest, commands, and results.

#### 17.27.5 Publish production `0.1.0` and make WebVOWL prove it

Once a release candidate is accepted, freeze observable behaviour. The production
release pull request may change only the version and approved release
documentation or metadata. Its accepted squash commit becomes the production source
commit and is manually dispatched through §§2.60–2.61; only after deterministic and
staged-candidate qualification is it tagged separately by the human. The
workflow must not author either change.
Any implementation or dependency change returns the process to a new release
candidate and repeats the candidate gate.

The production documentation and package surface freeze with the implementation.
`API.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, the shipped compatibility documents, public exports
and registry stability rows must describe the same retained tarball. The production
manifest continues to point directly at canonical readable ESM, contains no
TypeScript metadata or automatic lifecycle hooks, and introduces no `dist/`,
generated-code or source-map difference from the accepted candidate. The production
release pull request changes `publishConfig.tag` from the candidate's `next` to
`latest`, keeps the exact §2.39 discovery metadata/omissions, and proves the
version, `npm-release` environment request and explicit
`npm stage publish --tag latest` agree under §2.38. The proof-of-presence
approval verifies the already-fixed staged tag; it cannot repair a mismatch.
The §2.43 exports map, §2.44 `sideEffects: false`, §2.45 literal npm
`devEngines` patch and §§2.46–2.61 exact tooling, dependency shape, material,
workflow, Action-input, runner and verification contracts remain unchanged unless a
separate fully gated configuration change forced a new release candidate.

Build one retained `owlapi-0.1.0.tgz` from the reviewed production commit through the
approved manually dispatched same-run `release.yml` chain while the canonical
tag is absent.
Generate its
§2.47 validated reproducible CycloneDX 1.6 production-only library SBOM and
the exact §2.52 `SHA256SUMS`, compare the package/SBOM, locked/lockless graph,
strict-lint and third-party-material outputs with the accepted release candidate
and account for every difference. Run the
complete deterministic-artefact, required multi-engine Playwright and isolated
WebVOWL-candidate gates against that production tarball before requesting separate
authorization for the registry write.

After separate `npm-release` environment authorization, stage the exact retained tarball through §2.53 as
`owlapi@0.1.0` with `--tag latest`, record the returned stage ID and stop before
promotion. An interactively authenticated maintainer must inspect and download
that immutable candidate, verify the fixed `latest` tag and all metadata, prove
its SHA-256 is byte-for-byte identical to the retained tarball, rerun the
required tarball gates and bind the review evidence to the captured source
commit. Reject any mismatch while the canonical tag is still absent. Only after
that review may the human create and push `v0.1.0` at the captured commit and
approve the waiting `Release / tag accepted` job. The same run must verify its
signature, signer, target, GitHub result and review history and create/populate
the draft release. Bind the approval evidence to that source tag and commit.
Only then may `npm stage approve <stage-id>` assign `latest` through interactive
2FA as part of the separately authorized production operation. After that command
completes, approve `Release / publication confirmed`; only when this read-only
job starts may the workflow record the distribution-tag state before/after and
verify from a fresh cache:

```text
owlapi@0.1.0 resolves to the retained artefact
owlapi@latest resolves exactly to 0.1.0
owlapi@next still resolves to the accepted release candidate until cleanup
registry integrity and tarball contents match the retained evidence
the lockless fresh-consumer graph is recorded and reconciled with the locked release/SBOM graph
all five public entry points work in clean Node and browser-bundle consumers
all forbidden deep/RDF implementation paths fail
production dependency installation and audit pass
the installed manifest records publishConfig.tag=latest and the exact discovery metadata
the installed manifest has the exact sole exports map, sideEffects=false and approved npm devEngines patch, with no forbidden fallback/package-manager fields
the manifest/tarball contains no shrinkwrap, bundled, peer, optional, override or package-lock authority
local publint@0.3.24 passes the registry-downloaded tarball in strict mode
the production graph, third-party-material record, SBOM, package NOTICE and WebVOWL deployment-scope notices reconcile
the exact root owlapi coordinate passes registry-signature, provenance, publish-attestation, subject, repository, tag/commit/workflow and transparency validation
the @jspm/generator@2.16.3 reference/public-URL/local-mirror browser gate passes
the @playwright/test@1.62.1/vite@8.2.2 package-fixture matrix passes
the separate-workspace @cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm@6.0.1 production graph validates and reconciles independently
the Draft 2020-12 evidence schemas validate with ajv@8.20.0 plus ajv-formats@3.0.1
the no-telemetry/local-parsing network-denial suite passes
```

Also run the exact §2.51 npm signature/attestation gate, verify the registry
tarball's SHA-256 and retained SBOM against the draft release assets, and run
the registry tarball through strict §2.49 lint. Generate and attach
`owlapi-0.1.0.release-evidence.json` only after those fresh-registry checks,
validate its §2.40 fields and identities through the §2.47
Draft 2020-12/Ajv gate, and then publish that draft as an
immutable GitHub release. Verify its automatic release attestation covers all
four retained assets, execute the complete fresh-download §2.52 release/per-
asset/checksum/schema/signed-tag sequence, and commit the post-release repository
record containing the immutable evidence digest, release URL and attestation/
verification identities. At this
point
`SECURITY.md` changes its support table to the latest production 0.1.x line; the 0.x
prerelease ceases to be supported without being unpublished. Production release
notes preserve the required browser results and publication-time extended-test
matrix, with later extended evidence added only as dated append-only canonical
repository observations.

If a deterministic correction becomes necessary after immutable `v0.1.0` has
been pushed but before `owlapi@0.1.0` becomes public, do not approve the staged
candidate and do not move or delete the tag. Reject the stage, preserve the
§2.60 failed-attempt record, and prepare the same frozen production surface as
`0.1.1` through a new release pull request and complete release-candidate/production gate. In that
extraordinary branch, public `owlapi@0.1.0` remains absent, `0.1.1` becomes the
first Hadden Industries production release and exact WebVOWL cutover, and the plan must not
later reuse `0.1.0` merely because npm still reports that coordinate available.
Authentication, availability or ambiguous-write failures that require no input
change follow §2.58 reconciliation/retry rules and do not alone abandon the
version.

If any mandatory post-publication check rejects `0.1.0`, stop before the WebVOWL
production cutover and execute §2.33: remove `latest` because no earlier Hadden
Industries production release exists, deprecate `0.1.0` when safe, and prepare the first
corrective patch through a new release pull request, RC where implementation or
dependency behaviour changed, SSH-signed tag and complete retained-artefact
gate. Only that separately accepted patch may then become `latest` and the production
cutover version. The failed `0.1.0` release and evidence remain immutable.
Every removal of `latest`, exact-version deprecation and later reassignment is
recorded as a new timestamped §2.40 `registry-operations/` entry; it never
rewrites `0.1.0`'s original release record.

After production registry, provenance and consumer verification succeeds, inspect
the channel state once more. Under this plan there is no newer active
prerelease, so remove the stale pointer with the separately authorized
equivalent of:

```text
npm dist-tag rm owlapi next --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

Verify from a fresh registry query that `latest` still resolves exactly to the
production cutover version (normally `0.1.0`), `next` is absent, no unapproved
distribution tag exists, and bare `npm install owlapi` selects that exact
version. Do not repoint `next` to the production version or leave it pointing to a
release candidate. A future release programme recreates
`next` only by publishing a genuine newer prerelease. Retain the authorized tag
removal and its before/after result in production release evidence.

Then change the maintained WebVOWL manifest from the exact alpha/prerelease to
the exact registry dependency for the production cutover version—normally
`"owlapi": "0.1.0"`—regenerate the registry-backed lockfile, and verify its
tarball URL/integrity. Run the boundary test,
complete Jest suite, development build, production build, production ontology
corpus, and representative RDF/XML/imports workloads. Inspect the deployed
bundle to prove no removed package source or duplicate parser dependency was
reintroduced, regenerate WebVOWL's deployment-scope third-party inventory and
prove its bundled notices satisfy §2.50 independently from `owlapi`'s package
`NOTICE`.

#### 17.27.6 Completion

Phase 20 and this implementation plan complete only when:

- normally, public `owlapi@0.1.0` exists as the first Hadden Industries production release
  and either it is the accepted production cutover artefact or the separately
  recorded §2.33 branch has deprecated it and made the first fully verified
  corrective patch the `latest` production cutover artefact; solely if §2.60's
  post-tag/prepublication abandonment branch was activated, `0.1.0` remains
  unpublished and the next available fully gated same-surface patch—normally
  `0.1.1`—is the first production release and exact cutover;
- the obsolete Phase 20 `next` prerelease pointer has been separately removed,
  no unapproved distribution tag exists, and all tag mutations have durable
  before/after evidence;
- the production source commit, signed tag, tarball digest, registry integrity,
  SBOM, exact `SHA256SUMS`, normalized §2.51 npm root attestation, immutable
  GitHub release and all §2.52 per-asset/tag/checksum verification, plus the
  §2.53 stage ID/download/digest/approval binding and §2.61 authenticated
  manual-gate review history,
  `owlapi-<version>.release-evidence.json`, append-only repository release
  record, publication identity, and verification record are durable without
  depending on expired Actions logs;
- all five public entry points and every approved Java-compatible example pass
  from the installed package, the exact §2.43 exports map is the sole entry
  authority, and `owlapi/rdf`, metadata/extension aliases and deep imports fail;
- the §2.24 installed documentation set is complete and internally consistent,
  `API.md` exhaustively covers the executable public inventory, every protected
  binding has its §2.27 classification, and no TypeScript declaration or
  duplicate/generated production tree is published;
- the installed production manifest has the §2.39 description/keywords and omissions
  and its version, `publishConfig.tag`, authorized `--tag` and registry channel
  agree under §2.38;
- the installed production manifest has `sideEffects: false`, the complete
  package-owned closure passes §2.44 import-purity/tree-shaking checks, and its exact
  npm-native `devEngines` value is `12.0.2` and agrees with every §2.45
  workflow/evidence value; blocking jobs record Node `22.23.2`/`24.19.0`,
  while `engines.npm` and top-level `packageManager` remain absent;
- `ubuntu-24.04` x64 alone produced and published the retained artefact, the full
  Ubuntu Node matrix and all four `windows-2025` x64/`macos-15` arm64 installed-
  tarball lanes pass, every required job used the §2.57 explicit shell and
  supplied a valid label/OS/architecture/image record, and no moving, preview,
  self-hosted, container or runner-preinstalled-tool path supplied evidence;
- the exact `CI / required` and `Release / qualified` inventories are
  governance-verified, every mandatory conclusion is `success`, required
  matrices used `fail-fast: false` without neutralized failures, and the exact
  §2.58 timeout, workflow concurrency/cancellation/queue, controlled-read retry,
  one-attempt external-mutation and ambiguous-response reconciliation records
  prove that no skipped, cancelled or timed-out required job reached
  publication authority;
- the successful release evidence proves manual dispatch at the captured
  protected-`main` head, initial canonical-tag absence, completion of every
  deterministic gate before tag creation, pre-tag stage/download byte equality
  for the steady-state path, later human tag creation and verification before
  draft/public promotion, and any §2.60 failed-attempt/version-abandonment record
  is complete and append-only;
- `release-manual` has the exact protected-`main`, required-reviewer,
  no-secret/no-variable/no-custom-rule, self-review and `deployment: false`
  contract; the accepted tag gate and staged-only publication-confirmation gate
  occur in order without runner polling or mutation authority; and rejected,
  premature or expired reviews reconcile under §2.61 without duplicate writes;
- every external contributor’s fork run required maintainer execution approval
  without elevating code trust; fork and Dependabot CI had no secret, OIDC,
  environment or write authority; its candidate remained same-run diagnostic
  material; and the §2.59 untrusted-input/output, sensitive-log/debug,
  sanitization and exposure-incident controls are executable and evidenced;
- the exact `@jspm/generator@2.16.3` §2.46 reference map, integrity-verified
  provider URLs and local mirror pass through `@playwright/test@1.62.1` and its
  managed Chromium, Firefox and WebKit revisions in three separate cache-free,
  one-worker Ubuntu jobs without adding provider/shim code to the package; exact
  `vite@8.2.2` fixtures pass; and the separated
  `@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm@6.0.1` §2.47 production graph plus Draft 2020-12
  `ajv@8.20.0`/`ajv-formats@3.0.1` evidence records are durable;
- every npm release-control tool ran from the accepted lockfile through a named
  local npm script, GitHub CLI `2.98.0` passed its official checksum,
  `git-filter-repo@2.47.0` extraction identity/digest remains recorded, and no
  remote `npx`, global development tool or runner-preinstalled release CLI
  supplied evidence authority;
- the §2.48 ordinary exact-dependency manifest, locked/lockless graph records
  and read-only weekly monitor are active; strict retained/registry-tarball
  `publint` agrees with §2.49; and the §2.50 reviewed material inventory,
  package `NOTICE` and independently checked WebVOWL bundled notices agree with
  their actual distribution scopes;
- WebVOWL declares exactly `owlapi@0.1.0` when that is the production cutover
  version, or declares the exact recorded same-surface patch only when §2.60 or §2.33 was
  activated; in either branch it resolves from the public npm registry, contains
  no maintained package copy/alias/local dependency, and passes its complete
  production gates;
- WebVOWL contains no dependency used only by the extracted package and its
  deployment-scope third-party inventory/notices cover the emitted bundle;
- the refreshed package-identity/immutable-coordinate evidence and all legal/governance/security
  release gates are accepted, including valid §2.34 audit/exception evidence,
  §2.35 approval evidence, §2.36 signer evidence, the production support-window
  update, §2.41 CodeQL/secret-protection state and any unexpired source
  exceptions, operational private security/conduct channels, and a passing
  §2.42 zero-telemetry/local-network-denial gate, with no unresolved
  §§2.43–2.61 package/tooling/dependency/material/workflow/Action/runner/integrity
  gate; and
- the follow-on capability and W3C test-suite reporting programmes are linked as
  independent future work rather than represented as unfinished work in this
  plan.

Pause for the requested Git checkpoint before the production external publication
and again after the final package/WebVOWL evidence is committed. No required
work remains in this plan after that final checkpoint.

## 18. Testing and Verification Strategy

### 18.1 Testing principle: compare semantics, not serialization text

OWL 2 conformance includes syntax-translation tests whose successful outputs need only describe structurally equivalent ontologies; they do not require one particular serialization. Therefore tests should not compare RDF/XML strings except where testing a serializer itself.

#### 18.1.1 Test-first methodology depends on the kind of change, not the phase number

Development is test-first from the beginning of the migration, but do **not** force artificial RED states for behaviour-preserving mechanical refactors. Use three explicit modes:

| Change type                                                                                                                      | Required methodology              | Expected starting state                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| understand/protect existing legacy behaviour                                                                                     | characterization testing          | existing implementation defines observed behaviour, while known defects are labelled as defects |
| pure structural/refactoring change with no observable semantic change                                                            | **GREEN → GREEN**                 | relevant suites pass before and after each small change                                         |
| new capability, semantic correction, bug fix, OWLAPI parity addition, W3C mapping behaviour or other observable behaviour change | strict **RED → GREEN → REFACTOR** | first add a focused test that fails for the intended reason                                     |

For every known semantic defect, **no production fix occurs before a failing regression test demonstrates the defect**. For every newly implemented W3C/OWLAPI capability, create the focused specification/parity test before production behaviour is added.

Characterization tests document legacy behaviour; they do **not** establish correctness. Where characterized behaviour conflicts with normative W3C behaviour or an explicitly selected OWLAPI compatibility requirement:

1. preserve/document the legacy observation;
2. add a failing specification/parity test for the required behaviour;
3. implement the correction;
4. deliberately update/remove the obsolete characterization expectation.

The evidence precedence is therefore:

```text
normative/public specification
        ↓
explicit selected OWLAPI behavioural compatibility requirement
        ↓
legacy WebVOWL characterization
```

Tests must target the **new abstraction boundary**. OWL-native parsers are tested against structural OWL objects; RDF adapters against RDF/JS datasets; translators against structural/graph equivalence. Do not preserve obsolete RDF/XML string intermediates merely because they are convenient golden-test outputs.

### 18.2 Layer 1 — model unit tests

Test every structural object for:

- immutability;
- structural equality;
- structural key stability;
- unordered operand normalization;
- ordered operand preservation;
- duplicate elimination;
- annotation-sensitive equality;
- signature extraction.

Critical JavaScript regressions:

```text
A∩B == B∩A structurally where OWL defines an unordered set
new EqualAxiom() deduplicates against independently-created equivalent axiom
same logical axiom + different axiom annotation != structurally equal
```

### 18.3 Layer 2 — lexer/parser tests

Preserve exact lexical cases:

- delimiters;
- language tags (`@en` compound token);
- typed literals;
- escaped literals;
- multiline strings where syntax permits;
- comments;
- prefixes;
- Unicode/IRI handling;
- source positions;
- malformed inputs;
- strict/compatible recovery;
- distinct executable KRSS1 and KRSS2 parser boundaries, including shared-syntax ambiguity, KRSS2-only vocabulary rejection by KRSS1, exact explicit selection and generic `.krss` routing.

### 18.4 Layer 3 — syntax translation tests

For the same ontology encoded as Functional, OWL/XML, Manchester and RDF forms—and, for the subset expressible in those implemented dialects, **KRSS2 and DL Syntax**:

```text
parse(format A) → Oa
parse(format B) → Ob
assert structuralEquivalent(Oa, Ob)
```

Use W3C OWL 2 syntax-translation test cases through the pinned/classified conformance process: every case covering a `REQUIRED_V1` capability must be explicitly accounted for under §18.13.

### 18.5 Layer 4 — Java OWLAPI structural differential tests

The strongest parser oracle is Java OWLAPI itself.

Generate a canonical structural snapshot from Java rather than comparing concrete serialization. Example snapshot dimensions:

```text
ontology ID
imports declarations
ontology annotations
axiom type counts
canonical axiom representations
signatures by entity type
axiom annotations
anonymous-individual relationships
```

The JS side should generate the same normalized snapshot.

#### 18.5.1 Machine-readable expected-difference contract

Differential comparison **MUST** canonicalize only semantically irrelevant representation differences such as blank-node identifiers/isomorphism and order of unordered sets. Canonicalization **MUST NOT** be used to hide semantic differences.

After semantic canonicalization, every atomic Java-vs-JavaScript difference **MUST** be either absent or matched by exactly one approved machine-readable expected-difference rule.

Atomic difference types are at least:

```text
EXTRA
MISSING
VALUE_CHANGED
TYPE_CHANGED
```

JSON selectors **MUST** use RFC 9535 JSONPath.

Each expected-difference rule **MUST** support:

- stable ID;
- artifact type;
- fixture/bounded scope;
- parser/syntax/capability scope where required;
- difference category;
- side (`Java` or `JS`);
- exact JSONPath selector;
- exact/value constraints where required;
- match cardinality;
- rationale;
- governing specification/ADR/approved bug-fix authority.

Cardinality **MUST** be able to express exact N, min/max, zero-or-one, zero-or-more and one-or-more. Numeric semantic tolerances are forbidden.

The schema **MUST** permit narrowing an exception to one fixture, one entity, one exact JSON node, one difference kind, exact values and exactly one occurrence. Wildcards are allowed only when they still describe one precisely named semantic difference; broad catch-all subtree/field exclusions are forbidden.

Rules apply **after** atomic diffs are calculated and **MUST NOT** mutate/preprocess output to hide differences.

A differential gate is green only when:

```text
unmatched actual differences = 0
ambiguous rule matches = 0
unsatisfied required expected differences = 0
```

Stale expected-difference rules fail when their required minimum cardinality is no longer reached, unless explicitly optional with `min = 0` and documented rationale.

A W3C/normative conformance failure **MUST NOT** be waived through this mechanism. If Java OWLAPI is wrong and the JavaScript implementation is standards-correct, the conformance test passes and the exact Java-vs-JS behavioural difference is recorded here.

### 18.6 Layer 5 — OWL→RDF graph-equivalence tests

Compare:

```text
JS OWL structural model → JS OwlToRdfTranslator
Java OWLOntology        → Java RDFTranslator
```

using graph/dataset canonicalization/isomorphism, not blank-node IDs or RDF/XML text.

### 18.7 Layer 6 — RDF→OWL round-trip tests

For OWL graphs in the supported mapping domain:

```text
O
↓ OWL→RDF
G
↓ RDF→OWL
O'

assert structuralEquivalent(O, O')
```

Apply W3C mapping restrictions; do not assume every arbitrary RDF graph has a valid OWL 2 DL structural inverse.

### 18.8 Layer 7 — existing WebVOWL differential suite

The existing end-to-end corpus remains the migration gate:

1. Java OWL2VOWL reference output;
2. JS WebVOWL output through new architecture;
3. compare class/property/annotation/instance/disjoint/restriction/cardinality and other relevant fields.

This catches integration failures that parser unit tests cannot detect.

### 18.9 Layer 8 — graph/dataset tests

Include:

- default graph only;
- one named graph;
- multiple named graphs;
- identical triple in two named graphs;
- blank nodes shared across graphs (RDF dataset feature);
- ambiguous multi-graph ontology load;
- explicit merge compatibility policy;
- exact graph-policy cases: `requireSingleGraph`, `defaultGraphOnly`, `selectGraph`, and explicit graph-losing `merge`.

### 18.10 Layer 9 — imports tests

Include:

- direct/transitive/cyclic imports;
- missing import `throw` behaviour;
- missing import `diagnostic` continuation with mandatory structured diagnostic;
- local IRI mappings;
- remote import disabled;
- repeated imported document deduplication;
- anonymous-individual standardization concerns across import closure.

### 18.11 Layer 10 — performance/memory regressions

Automate benchmarks for:

- large valid Manchester/Functional ontologies;
- large unrelated input attempted by an early-reject parser;
- large RDF/XML/Turtle streams;
- deeply nested expressions;
- large RDF lists;
- import closure loading;
- `VOWLBuilder` on representative large ontologies.

Measure peak heap as well as wall time. A parser that is marginally faster but creates a catastrophic heap spike is not an improvement.

### 18.12 Layer 11 — fuzz/property tests

Use bounded fuzz/property tests for:

- malformed tokens;
- XML nesting/entities;
- cyclic/malformed RDF lists;
- parser sniffers;
- structural key stability;
- round-trip invariants.

Fuzzers must themselves obey resource limits in CI.

### 18.13 Standards conformance suite governance

Every `REQUIRED_V1` capability for which an authoritative standards test/conformance suite exists **MUST** use an explicitly pinned suite version/revision.

For each suite the repository **MUST** record:

- suite name and governing specification/version;
- authoritative upstream location;
- immutable revision/commit/release identifier;
- retrieval date;
- reproducibly stored/retrieved upstream manifest;
- project runner/adapter.

Moving branches such as `main`, `master` or `latest` **MUST NOT** be the normative CI reference.

Every test in the pinned upstream suite **MUST** have exactly one machine-readable classification:

```text
REQUIRED
NOT_APPLICABLE
EXCLUDED_WITH_REASON
```

No upstream test may remain unclassified.

`REQUIRED` tests exercise the declared standards surface and **MUST** pass. A failing `REQUIRED` test fails CI/phase acceptance and **MUST NOT** be reclassified merely because implementation is difficult or the WebVOWL corpus does not expose the issue.

`NOT_APPLICABLE` requires a reason category/rationale such as `DIFFERENT_SYNTAX`, `DIFFERENT_SPECIFICATION_VERSION`, `DEFERRED_CAPABILITY`, `UNSUPPORTED_BY_DESIGN` or `RUNNER_NOT_RELEVANT`. “Currently failing”, “difficult” or “probably unimportant” are not valid reasons.

`EXCLUDED_WITH_REASON` is exceptional and reserved for a documented upstream-test defect, specification/test-suite inconsistency, unsupported environment assumption or equivalent approved condition. Each exclusion **MUST** identify the exact test, evidence, approval reference and reconsideration condition.

CI **MUST** verify complete coverage:

```text
pinned upstream tests
=
REQUIRED + NOT_APPLICABLE + EXCLUDED_WITH_REASON
```

with no duplicates or unclassified/stale entries.

Positive and negative syntax/evaluation tests **MUST** both be preserved where applicable. “Did not crash” is not a conformance outcome.

Syntax-adapter conformance **MUST** be tested at the syntax/RDF boundary before RDF→OWL interpretation. A correct Turtle/RDF/XML/etc. parse followed by an RDF→OWL failure **MUST NOT** be misreported as syntax-parser nonconformance.

Passing an upstream suite is necessary where applicable but not sufficient for complete project correctness. Project-owned parser-selection, adapter-contract, security/resource, regression, differential, cross-format and WebVOWL tests remain required.

A standards-backed phase **MUST NOT** complete until its suite is pinned, every upstream test is classified, every `REQUIRED` test passes, every exclusion has approved evidence, and the runner is reproducible in CI.

### 18.14 Reusable lessons become durable current protection

A reusable lesson **MUST NOT** be considered captured merely because it appears in a historical lesson file. Where applicable it **MUST** be institutionalized in the current playbook, normative contract, regression/contract/conformance test, architecture fitness rule, security/resource test, performance benchmark, capability matrix, expected-difference manifest or approved normative decision.

Executable institutionalization is **RECOMMENDED** whenever the lesson can be expressed reliably as an automated invariant.

### 18.15 Release browser matrix and evidence states

The package release suite **MUST** install the retained tarball and execute the
same representative public-manager workflows through exact
`@playwright/test@1.62.1` and its managed Chromium, Firefox and WebKit revisions
as three separately reported, one-worker, cache-free `ubuntu-24.04` x64 jobs
under §2.57. Browser installation uses the locally locked Playwright CLI and no
container or runner browser. Package-owned bundler/worker fixtures use exact
`vite@8.2.2`. This is a blocking browser-engine gate,
not merely a build or DOM-contract simulation. All three results must be valid
and passing for each published package version. The three required jobs use
`strategy.fail-fast: false`, do not use `continue-on-error`, and feed their real
conclusions into the §2.58 aggregate; one failure does not cancel the other
engine evidence and no failure is rewritten as success.

The distinct Node OS/architecture gate installs the same retained tarball into
both approved Node patches on `windows-2025` x64 and `macos-15` arm64. It is
blocking but focused: it proves the public boundary and representative loads do
not depend on Linux path, shell, encoding or architecture behavior without
duplicating the full Ubuntu semantic/conformance suite.
These required portability lanes use the same fail-fast-disabled, no-allow-
failure and aggregate-conclusion contract.

Branded channels, historical versions, hosted services and real-device runs use
the non-blocking evidence contract in §2.16.1 through the read-only scheduled or
manual default-branch `extended-tests.yml` workflow. It has no `npm-release`,
OIDC, repository-write or cross-workflow release-candidate authority. Their
public matrix permits only
`PASS`, `FAIL` and reasoned/date-stamped `NOT_RUN`; infrastructure errors are
transient diagnostic events and never terminal release states. A later run
updates the version-specific repository report without rebuilding, republishing
or altering the immutable package release.

### 18.16 Workflow trust-boundary and hostile-metadata tests

The governance suite **MUST** parse the effective workflow files and approved
repository-settings snapshot rather than rely on text search alone. It proves
that `pull_request` is the only untrusted-code trigger; no path reaches a secret,
OIDC, environment or write permission; the external-contributor approval policy
is exact; workflow PR creation/approval is disabled; and every fork-produced
artefact consumer belongs to the same unprivileged CI run/attempt.

Project-owned workflow-data helpers receive hostile fixtures covering quotes,
shell metacharacters, expression-like text, Unicode controls, newlines,
workflow-command delimiters, path traversal, oversized fields and malicious but
valid branch/title/email shapes. Tests prove each value is rejected or preserved
only as bounded data, cannot change a command/output/path/selector and cannot
forge `GITHUB_ENV`/`GITHUB_OUTPUT`/summary content. Security-relevant consumers
must independently reject malformed producer output.

A fixture-level workflow audit proves that context/environment dumps, trace/
debug switches, credential command-line arguments and unsanitized retained logs
are absent from privileged jobs. A non-mutating incident rehearsal exercises
stop/revoke-or-rotate/remove/inspect/fresh-authorization state transitions using
fake credentials and fixture artefacts; it never intentionally exposes a real
secret merely to test masking.

### 18.17 Late-tag release-ordering and immutable-boundary tests

The workflow-governance suite **MUST** parse `release.yml` and prove that
`workflow_dispatch` is its sole trigger; a tag push cannot start it; the initial
guard accepts only `refs/heads/main`; the captured `github.sha` must equal the
queried protected-`main` head at dispatch; release identity is derived from the
reviewed manifest; and no free-form version, tag, commit, registry, channel or
package-name input exists. Fixtures cover a branch dispatch, a tag dispatch, a
stale/non-head commit, an existing canonical tag, an unexpectedly existing npm
coordinate, a later harmless advance of `main` after capture and malformed
SemVer/channel metadata.

A project-owned release-state-machine test executes both `DIRECT_BOOTSTRAP` and
`OIDC_STAGED` with mocked GitHub/npm boundaries and asserts an exact ordered event
ledger. Every deterministic build/test/package/consumer conclusion and `Release
/ qualified` must precede tag creation. In `OIDC_STAGED`, stage creation, stage
view/download, retained-versus-staged SHA-256 equality and staged-candidate
revalidation must additionally precede canonical-tag creation. In both modes,
local/GitHub tag verification must precede draft-release mutation and every
public npm write or promotion. No state transition may repack or substitute the
same-run artefact ID.

Negative tests attempt to stage before `Release / qualified`, create a tag before
qualification or staged-byte review, create/populate a draft before tag
verification, approve a stage without interactive-review evidence, run the npm
job from a non-`main` ref, move/delete/recreate an existing canonical tag, or
reuse that version from a corrected commit. Each must fail before the forbidden
mutation. Ambiguous remote results exercise only read-only reconciliation.
Stage-lifecycle fixtures cover a missing/expired/rejected/non-pending stage at
both the pre-tag and pre-approval reads, changed stage identity/tag/digest, absent
timestamp fields and an undocumented retention assumption. They require fresh
`stage view` checks at both boundaries, never infer npm retention from GitHub's
30-day wait, and route recovery through the applicable pre-tag reuse or post-tag
abandonment rule without blind restaging.
Failure fixtures distinguish pre-tag correction, unchanged-input transient
failure, post-tag/prepublication deterministic abandonment and post-publication
§2.33 containment; they validate the append-only failed-attempt schema and the
exact `0.1.0-alpha.1`/`0.1.1` successor rules without making a real registry or
Git-ref write.

### 18.18 Same-run manual-handoff and review-history tests

The workflow/repository-governance suite **MUST** prove that exactly one
`release-manual` environment exists; it permits only protected `main`, names
`MaksymShostak` as required reviewer, leaves prevent-self-review disabled and has
no wait timer, custom protection rule, secret or variable. Every referencing job
must spell `deployment: false`, have only `contents: read` plus `actions: read`
and be unreachable from pull-request, Dependabot, maintenance or extended-test
execution. `npm-release` remains the only trusted-publisher/registry-authority
environment.

State-machine fixtures assert the exact graph. `DIRECT_BOOTSTRAP` has one
`Release / tag accepted` wait after deterministic qualification/tag creation and
before tag verification, draft mutation or npm authority. `OIDC_STAGED` has that
same gate only after stage view/download/digest revalidation, then a distinct
`Release / publication confirmed` wait after draft creation and interactive
stage promotion but before registry verification. No gate is represented as the
npm write itself, no bootstrap-only second gate exists, and no candidate is
rebuilt across either boundary.

Mocked `GET /actions/runs/{run_id}/approvals` responses cover the authorized
single bootstrap review, two ordered staged-release reviews, rejection,
premature approval, unexpected reviewer, extra re-run history and the 30-day
expiry/reconciliation path. Evidence validation preserves every review and
correlates it with run/attempt and gate job state without parsing an approval
comment or requiring custom Git-tag trailers. Negative source/workflow scans
reject any `sleep` or polling loop used to wait for human tag creation or
publication confirmation in either manual-handoff job, approval Actions,
environment secrets/variables, write/OIDC permission on either manual job, a
draft before tag acceptance, and public verification before publication
confirmation. Bounded propagation reads after an approved gate remain allowed
under §2.58.

## 19. Security and Resource-Safety Requirements

Security belongs in the architecture, especially because ontology documents can be attacker-controlled and imports/JSON-LD can trigger network activity.

### 19.1 Bounded format detection

`MAX_SNIFF_BYTES = 8192` is the normative default detection ceiling. Every parser detector **MUST** remain within it unless an approved benchmark/security-backed change updates the limit.

### 19.2 XML entities

XML external entities **MUST NOT** be fetched.

If compatibility requires supported internal entity declarations, processing **MUST** be bounded by the finite XML/entity limits in the authoritative resource budget, including declaration count, replacement length, expansion depth and total expanded bytes. Limit violations **MUST** raise `ResourceLimitError`; processing **MUST NOT** continue with truncated or silently omitted semantic content.

“Resolve entities like Java” **MUST NOT** mean enabling unconstrained DTD/entity expansion.

### 19.3 JSON-LD remote contexts

`remoteJsonLdContexts` defaults to `false`. The core **MUST NOT** dereference a remote `@context` merely because `jsonld.js` or the runtime can perform network I/O.

When explicitly enabled, remote context loading **MUST** use the injected/controlled document-loader policy defined in §10.8, including explicit schemes, credential restrictions, SSRF controls, redirect revalidation, finite byte/time/redirect limits and `AbortSignal` support. Retries remain disabled unless explicitly configured.

### 19.4 Remote OWL imports and SSRF

`remoteImports` defaults to `false`; the core has no ambient network-import permission.

Local/injected IRI mappers/resolvers **MAY** resolve imports without network access. If an import remains unresolved, the default `missingImportHandling: "throw"` raises `MissingImportError`.

When remote loading is explicitly enabled, the injected loader **MUST** enforce the §10.8 policy and **MUST** reject unsafe targets such as loopback, private/link-local networks and metadata-service endpoints unless a separately approved application policy explicitly permits a safe case. Redirect targets **MUST** be revalidated.

The core **MUST NOT** automatically dereference arbitrary `file:`, `ftp:`, `gopher:`, `data:`, `javascript:`, `smb:` or equivalent schemes. Browser CORS and the mere presence of global `fetch` **MUST NOT** be treated as security authorization.

### 19.5 Normative resource-safety limits

The project **MUST** maintain one authoritative machine-readable resource/performance budget (conceptually `docs/owlapi-js/performance/resource-budgets.yaml`, with exact path/serialization following repository convention). Phase 0 **MUST** establish it before later parser phases rely on safety/performance acceptance.

Resource safety limits are deterministic hard ceilings; performance budgets are regression gates tied to a defined benchmark environment. They **MUST NOT** be conflated.

Every relevant dimension capable of unbounded memory, CPU, recursion, expansion or network work **MUST** have a finite default. The Phase 0 budget **MUST** define at least:

```text
maxInputBytes
maxTokenLength
maxTokenCount
maxAxioms
maxQuads
maxBlankNodes
maxRdfListLength
maxExpressionDepth
maxAnnotationDepth
maxImportDepth
maxImportCount
maxXmlNestingDepth
maxEntityDeclarations
maxEntityReplacementLength
maxEntityExpansionDepth
maxExpandedXmlBytes
maxRemoteDocumentBytes
timeoutMs
maxRedirects
maxRetries
```

Parser-specific limits **MAY** be added only for genuinely syntax-specific resources. Equivalent limits **MUST** share the same configuration name/unit across parsers.

Phase 0 **MUST** derive numeric values from the complete pinned real-world corpus, known large valid fixtures, standards-conformance fixtures, adversarial/pathological fixtures and practical browser/Node constraints. Each budget entry **MUST** record exact value/unit, evidence, observed valid maxima where relevant, headroom rationale and failure behaviour.

Exceeding a safety limit **MUST** raise `ResourceLimitError` with code `RESOURCE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` and at least `resource` and `limit`; `observed` is included only when obtainable safely. The failure is fatal in both parsing modes, permits no parser fallback and leaves no partially committed ontology.

Implementations **MUST** enforce limits as early as practical rather than first consuming the unbounded resource.

### 19.6 ReDoS prevention

Detectors and token regular expressions **MUST NOT** contain known pathological backtracking patterns. Complex expressions applied to attacker-controlled or potentially large input **MUST** have adversarial regression tests and remain bounded by the applicable input/detection limits.

### 19.7 No `eval` / dynamic code generation

Ontology syntax parsing **MUST NOT** use `eval`, the `Function` constructor, source-driven dynamic module execution, or execute scripts embedded in ontology documents.

### 19.8 Diagnostics and source excerpts

Avoid echoing arbitrarily large source chunks into errors/logs. Truncate diagnostic excerpts and avoid exposing sensitive import credentials/authorization headers.

### 19.9 Vulnerability disclosure is private and release-integrity preserving

Operational vulnerability handling follows §2.17. GitHub private vulnerability
reporting is preferred; `security@haddenindustries.com` is the fallback. Public
issues, discussions and pull requests are not vulnerability channels. Embargoed
reports, proof-of-concept material, mailbox membership and reporter identity are
never copied into ordinary diagnostics, public CI logs or release evidence.

Security urgency may shorten scheduling and review latency, but it does not
authorize an unverified package build. Every security release still uses the
single retained tarball, required multi-engine tests, production audit, SBOM,
checksums, provenance, registry re-download and immutable-release gates.

### 19.10 No telemetry or ambient package networking

The §2.42 zero-telemetry contract is a security and privacy boundary, not merely
a README preference. Package import, manager construction, format registration,
local parsing, diagnostics and lifecycle handling perform no outbound request.
The package contains no analytics/telemetry endpoint, update service, remote
configuration service, crash uploader or install/publish callback.

Remote ontology imports and JSON-LD contexts remain the only caller-authorized
network cases and continue to require their explicit disabled-by-default
configuration, injected loader and §19.3–19.4 controls. Tests instrument or deny
the same private network seam used by production code and fail on any request
outside an explicitly enabled document-resolution scenario. A dependency update
that introduces an undeclared request is a security/contract regression even if
the package's own source did not add a direct `fetch` call.

---

## 20. Performance and Browser Architecture

### 20.1 Stream where the syntax/library supports it

RDF adapters **SHOULD** preserve streaming as far as the selected library and semantic boundary permit. Parser-level streaming **MUST NOT** compromise complete RDF graph/dataset context where RDF→OWL requires it.

OWL-native textual parsers **MUST** preserve lazy/pull-based tokenization unless the grammar demonstrably requires bounded buffering, and **MUST** regression-test the previously observed eager-tokenization/V8-heap failure class.

### 20.2 Avoid premature duplicate indexing

Build indexes required by measured high-value queries. Do not duplicate derived state speculatively.

### 20.3 Web Worker compatibility

Portable parsing/model/translation code **MUST** avoid Window/UI assumptions so
the declared 0.1.0 surface can execute in a bundler-resolved dedicated module
worker. XML capability selection supplies a private worker-safe fallback because
`DOMParser` is Window-only. Worker transfer representations **MUST** preserve
canonical structural `kind` identities and semantics or expose an explicitly
documented structured-clone-safe projection; no test may accidentally pass by
returning only a success boolean while discarding the parsed result. Document
import maps do not apply in the worker and are not part of this compatibility
mechanism. Shared/service workers and worklets remain outside the 0.1.0 claim.

### 20.4 Dynamic parser loading

Optional/later syntax adapters **MAY** be dynamically loaded only when doing so preserves deterministic registry semantics, public capability declarations and package/export contracts. `REQUIRED_V1` capability availability **MUST NOT** become accidental runtime nondeterminism.

### 20.5 Cache derived RDF, not mutable truth

If OWL→RDF results are cached for performance, they remain derived data. The canonical ontology truth is the immutable structural model.

### 20.6 Normative performance budgets and benchmark environment

Phase 0 **MUST** define and pin a representative benchmark corpus covering at least small/medium/large valid ontologies, the largest relevant real-world ontology, large Functional/Manchester/OWL/XML/RDF/XML/RDF inputs, deeply nested valid expressions, long RDF lists, representative import closures, large mismatched input exercising early rejection and representative complete WebVOWL conversion. Later syntax phases add representative fixtures before completion.

Performance measurement **MUST** include at least wall-clock duration and peak heap usage. Throughput/allocation metrics **SHOULD** be captured where useful. A runtime improvement **MUST NOT** excuse catastrophic heap regression, nor vice versa.

Performance thresholds **MUST** be evaluated in a defined benchmark environment recording relevant OS/runtime versions, architecture, memory settings where material, dependency lockfile, fixture revisions, warm-up method, measured-run count and aggregation statistic.

The benchmark environment record **MUST** also include the concurrent-load state of the machine, which is a property of the moment of measurement rather than a static property of the environment. A release-gated measurement **MUST** be taken with no other benchmark, test run, build or bulk file-scanning work in progress. A benchmark **MUST NOT** be executed in the background alongside other work: sustained contention inflates wall time by a factor indistinguishable from a genuine regression, and backgrounding removes the waiting period during which the interference would otherwise be noticed. This requirement **SHOULD** be enforced by an executable pre-flight check rather than by convention alone.

Phase 0 **MUST** establish available legacy baselines. Each completed migration establishes a new accepted baseline after its Definition of Done passes. A baseline **MUST NOT** be updated merely because a regression made the old threshold fail.

Every release-gated benchmark **MUST** have an explicit threshold, expressed as an absolute bound in the pinned environment, a maximum permitted regression relative to approved baseline, or both. Exact thresholds are derived from Phase 0 evidence rather than invented by later teams.

Designated bounded parser-selection mismatch signals use a combined threshold
because allocator-sized changes dominate percentage comparisons when the entire
median is only tens of kilobytes. Their wall-time median **MUST** remain within
20% of the last accepted baseline. Their peak-heap-delta median **MUST** either
remain within the same 20% relative limit or remain at or below the absolute
64 KiB (65,536-byte) ceiling. Use of the absolute branch additionally **MUST**
measure at least three strictly increasing input sizes—1 MiB, 4 MiB, and 16 MiB
in the current benchmark corpus—and every size **MUST** remain at or below that
same fixed ceiling. This exception applies only to early-rejection/detection
signals; valid parsing, translation, publication, and rendering workloads retain
the ordinary relative budgets. A new parser **MUST NOT** gain a larger absolute
ceiling merely because its detector fails the scaling check.

Performance gates **MUST** use repeated measurements and a predefined aggregation/noise policy. Re-running a failing benchmark until one favourable sample passes is forbidden. That prohibition forbids **selecting** a favourable sample; it does **NOT** forbid discarding a measurement demonstrated to be invalid, provided the demonstration is evidenced and the discarded measurement and its cause are recorded.

Repeated measurement and aggregation **MUST NOT** be treated as protection against sustained interference. They defend against random, short-lived noise; sustained contention inflates every run by a similar factor, so a tight run-to-run spread is evidence of sustained conditions rather than of clean conditions. Accordingly, a threshold breach **MUST** be corroborated independently before it is recorded as a finding, a regression or a gate failure. At least one of the following is required: an isolated repeat of a single run, a scaling check across input sizes, or an arithmetic consistency check against related signals.

Parser-selection performance is part of the contract: a large input that does not belong to a candidate syntax **MUST** be rejected through bounded detection/fail-fast behaviour rather than eagerly tokenizing/parsing the full document merely to discover mismatch.

A capability supporting browser and Node.js **MUST** undergo relevant resource-safety testing in both. Performance budgets **MAY** differ by pinned environment; semantic resource-limit behaviour **MUST** remain consistent unless an explicit public configuration rule says otherwise.

Changing a normative safety limit requires valid-use-case evidence, security/resource analysis, updated adversarial tests, updated machine-readable budget and project approval. A limit **MUST NOT** simply be increased until a failing fixture passes.

Changing a performance threshold requires benchmark evidence, confirmation that the change is not hiding an avoidable regression, project approval and a committed rationale/baseline update.

A subject phase **MUST NOT** complete unless applicable hard-limit tests pass, adversarial cases fail with the expected `ResourceLimitError`, benchmarks remain within release thresholds and any budget change followed the approved process.

## 21. JavaScript and Packaging Best Practices

### 21.1 ESM-first

Use:

```json
{
  "type": "module"
}
```

The project already follows modern module conventions, and Node documents `"type": "module"` as the mechanism for treating `.js` files as ESM.

### 21.2 Explicit package `exports`

When extracted as a package, define a stable `exports` map. Current Node documentation recommends `exports` for new packages because it defines and encapsulates supported entry points.

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "owlapi",
  "version": "0.1.0-alpha.0",
  "description": "OWL 2 ontology parsing and structural APIs for Node.js and browsers, designed for practical compatibility with Java OWLAPI concepts.",

```

Before Phase 19, `src/owlapi-js/` is the WebVOWL staging root. After the
history-preserving handoff, the root of the independent
`Hadden-Industries/owlapi` repository is both the canonical source root and npm
package root. The public compatibility tree follows the registered Java package
suffixes and owns the sole canonical definitions of public bindings. Private
engines use the non-exported, responsibility-oriented `internal/` tree; do not
create a duplicated `internal/apibinding`, `internal/model`, `internal/io` or
`internal/formats` mirror merely to add forwarding barrels.

Do not expose every internal parser/utility file as accidental API. Except for
`.`, any later export key is permitted only when its exact suffix is an existing
`org.semanticweb.owlapi` package and the Public API Surface Registry authorizes
it. Use explicit keys rather than wildcard export patterns. The first-release
`publishConfig` repeats the registry/tag decision defensively; it does not
replace the explicit reviewed-tarball command or its external authorization.
Every later release pull request changes its tag only as required by §2.38 and
the executable channel-consistency gate. Description and keywords are the exact
§2.39 discovery metadata; `funding`, `contributors`, author email and invented
maintainer metadata remain absent.
`sideEffects: false` is required by §2.44 and its complete-closure import-purity/
tree-shaking gate in §17.26 is release-blocking. The five export keys shown
above are the sole §2.43 entry authority; their target
filenames, registry rows, named facades, source modules and retained tarball
must agree. The Browserslist value shown is the alpha value; Phase 20 replaces
it with the §2.20 dated production-freeze query before the first release candidate.
The six `dependencies` values and eight release-control `devDependencies` values
shown are the exact Phase 19 targets under §§2.32 and 2.54. The six runtime
dependencies are ordinary external runtime dependencies under §§2.32 and 2.48. Their
coordinated WebVOWL staging qualification was completed on 24 August 2026 with
dependency-specific evidence inside one approved gate; Phase 19 must preserve
and rerun that accepted baseline rather than repeat the version-selection work.
The repository `package-lock.json` records the accepted release graph but is not
a package file. The manifest has no
`bundleDependencies`/`bundledDependencies`, `peerDependencies`,
`optionalDependencies` or `overrides`, and the package has no
`npm-shrinkwrap.json`. Other package-owned test/lint/format development
dependencies retained by the extraction are separately inventoried and approved;
they do not weaken or replace the eight exact release-control authorities, and
no development dependency becomes a runtime dependency.

The `files` value is the §2.23–2.24 approved shape, subject only to the final
exact package-manifest/configuration approval and proof that every transitive
runtime-relative import is covered. README and licence are listed deliberately
even though npm also includes them automatically. No `main`, `browser`,
`module`, `engines.npm`, top-level `packageManager`, `types`, `typings`,
package-level condition, wildcard/metadata/extension-alias export or automatic
lifecycle hook is implied by omitted illustrative fields. The exact §2.45
`devEngines` object uses the frozen npm `12.0.2` value; the manifest, lockfile,
workflows and release evidence must agree on it and must not substitute a range.
The negative
patterns intentionally follow all positive entries because current
`npm-packlist` evaluates negations in order; the release gate verifies that
behaviour rather than assuming it.

#### 21.2.1 WebVOWL must use the external package boundary

After Phase 19, WebVOWL and `owlapi` do not share a repository or package-manager
workspace. WebVOWL declares an exact registry version in production
dependencies and imports the same public specifiers documented for third
parties. Node, Jest and Vite select entry points through the installed package's
`exports` map. The committed lockfile resolves the npm registry artefact and its
integrity, not a mutable branch, sibling checkout, local tarball or link.

Do not add a convenience alias such as
`owlapi → ../owlapi/index.js`: it would make application builds pass even if
the published manifest were missing an export or the tarball omitted a file.
Do not make WebVOWL tests privileged consumers of deep internals either.
Package-internal tests may test internals in `Hadden-Industries/owlapi`;
WebVOWL tests demonstrate only what a real installed-package consumer can
construct and observe.

This is intentionally a three-part verification model:

1. package-repository CI verifies implementation, conformance and packability;
2. the retained tarball is exercised in isolated generic consumers and an
   isolated WebVOWL candidate checkout before publication; and
3. normal WebVOWL installs, tests and builds continuously verify the exact
   public-registry artefact after publication.

No gate substitutes for another. Local exploratory tools may unpack the
candidate in disposable directories, but no committed consumer configuration
may encode a development-only route.

#### 21.2.2 Browser resolution has two supported owners

Bundlers and document import maps consume the same explicit public exports but
own resolution differently. A package-aware bundler reads npm metadata and
constructs an optimized application graph. A browser import map belongs to the
HTML document and maps public and transitive bare specifiers to URLs chosen by
that application. Package source remains ordinary native ESM in both cases.

Generate the version-pinned reference map from the packed artefact and its
literal dynamic imports with exact §2.46 `@jspm/generator@2.16.3`,
`jspm.io`, `production`/`browser`/`module` and integrity configuration; do not
hand-maintain a second export registry. The reference is evidence and a
consumer example, not a universal package setting or availability promise.
Before real-engine testing, integrity-check and locally mirror the exact
provider graph without transforming it, while separately verifying the public
reference URLs. It must not hard-code a provider into production source,
bypass public exports, inject `es-module-shims`, or suggest that import maps
themselves transform CommonJS. Document maps do not propagate to workers, so
dedicated-worker support is verified independently through the bundler fixture.
See §§2.21, 2.46 and 17.26.1.2 for the normative acceptance matrix.

#### 21.2.3 Dependency authority remains explicit and one-layered

The published manifest tells consumers which external runtime packages the
implementation requires; it does not prescribe every transitive version in a
future application. All six direct runtime packages therefore appear once, as
exact ordinary `dependencies`. They are not repeated as peers or optionals,
embedded with the tarball, redirected through root-only overrides or frozen for
downstream consumers by a publishable shrinkwrap.

The source repository's lockfile and the fresh lockless-consumer graph answer
different questions. The former makes development, CI, SBOM generation and the
reviewed release graph reproducible. The latter proves that the public manifest
still resolves and works as an ordinary library when a consumer does not inherit
that lock. Both are release evidence; only `package.json` is dependency authority
inside the npm tarball. See §§2.32, 2.48 and 17.26.2.

### 21.3 Named exports

Prefer named exports for domain classes/functions. Each registered namespace has
an explicit `index.js` facade, and the root aggregate explicitly re-exports only
the approved ordinary-workflow subset. Every public binding has one canonical
definition in its Java-shaped namespace; cohesive public types may share a
module, but no binding is redefined beneath `internal/`. Private modules use
direct relative imports to avoid barrel cycles.

### 21.4 Native JavaScript only; TypeScript declarations are not a deliverable

The initial `owlapi` release line **MUST** be authored as native ESM JavaScript.

The core migration **MUST NOT** introduce:

- TypeScript source files;
- the TypeScript compiler as a build/development dependency;
- `tsc`;
- `checkJs`;
- TypeScript-driven declaration generation;
- TypeScript-based exhaustive-dispatch enforcement.

JSDoc **MAY** be used where it improves documentation or maintainability, but the project **MUST NOT** depend on TypeScript tooling to interpret it.

Structural exhaustiveness **MUST** be enforced through the canonical `kind` vocabulary, centralized exhaustive dispatchers, runtime validation and automated completeness tests.

The current build/test workflow **MUST** execute directly from JavaScript without a TypeScript compilation stage.

Under §2.26, TypeScript declaration files are not merely optional: the
`0.1.0-alpha.0` and `0.1.0` manifests and retained tarballs **MUST NOT** claim or
ship an official declaration surface. Introducing TypeScript source/tooling,
generated or hand-maintained `.d.ts` declarations, a `types`/`typings` field or
an official `@types/owlapi` package **MUST NOT** occur during this plan. As §2.26
states, only a separately authorized, non-implementing exploration may later
compare options; that possibility is neither scheduled work nor a release
commitment.

### 21.5 No import side effects

Parser registration should happen through an explicit registry/factory bootstrap, not modules that mutate global registries merely by being imported. This improves tests, bundle analysis and tree shaking.

### 21.6 Selected v1 dependencies

The selected foundational dependencies are:

```text
@rdfjs/data-model
@rdfjs/dataset
@xmldom/xmldom
jsonld
n3
rdfxml-streaming-parser
```

They **MUST** be used for the roles defined in §6 unless an approved replacement decision changes the normative plan. Exact versions are pinned when introduced.

`rdf-parse`, Comunica, rdflib, `rdf-ext` or another generalized RDF framework **MUST NOT** become an undeclared core runtime dependency merely to duplicate dispatcher functionality. They **MAY** be used in tests, experiments or future optional integration packages.

### 21.7 Dependency-governance policy

For each foundational dependency, record standards grounding, conformance
evidence, governance/release authority, maintenance status, transitive
supply-chain surface, runtime/browser cost, security/network behaviour,
licence/notice obligations and replaceable adapter boundary. The package
manifest, repository lockfile, production SBOM and §2.50 material inventory must
identify the same six direct runtime components and accepted versions.

A dependency replacement or material upgrade **MUST** rerun the applicable
conformance, adapter-contract, differential, security/resource, browser/Node and
performance gates. A phase **MUST NOT** silently upgrade a foundational
dependency while doing unrelated semantic migration work. The update is tested
both in the repository-locked graph and in the independent lockless consumer
graph defined by §2.48; an exact direct pin does not justify publishing a
shrinkwrap, bundling the dependency or recasting an implementation engine as a
peer.

The weekly `owlapi@latest` monitor detects later transitive-resolution drift
without creating a second update authority. It may open or update one structured
finding, but only the ordinary reviewed dependency pull request and new-version
release process may change package state. Licence/notice review follows the
bytes actually distributed: the package record and `NOTICE` cover the npm
tarball, while the WebVOWL build separately inventories code embedded in its
deployment bundle.

### 21.8 Browser/Node XML adapter

Rather than scattering environment checks through OWL/XML parser code, normalize XML parsing behind one `XmlParserAdapter` using native browser `DOMParser` where appropriate and the chosen Node implementation in Node/tests.

The adapter selects by capability, not by runtime name. Because `DOMParser` is
not exposed in a dedicated worker, its private fallback must also be reachable
through the supported bundled-worker graph without making that fallback eager
in ordinary Window bundles. Node, Window and dedicated-worker tests normalize
the same public parse/error semantics; import maps are not used as a worker
resolution mechanism.

## 22. Licensing Independence and Source-Provenance Gate

This section is a **core implementation constraint**, not merely a publication checklist. Its purpose is to preserve the project's freedom to choose an appropriate licence later—whether permissive or copyleft—without unnecessarily inheriting implementation-level obligations from Java OWLAPI source.

The architectural goal is therefore stronger than “pick a compatible licence”: **the new `owlapi-js` production code should be independently authored from public specifications and project-owned compatibility evidence.** Java OWLAPI remains an extremely valuable behavioural oracle, but its implementation source is not the design source for the replacement implementation.

### 22.1 Why licence-choice independence matters

The existing WebVOWL parser code is described as having been ported in significant part from Java OWLAPI source. Moving such code into a new directory or repository does not erase that provenance, and merely choosing a new repository-level licence does not by itself determine the obligations that may attach to historically derived material.

The cleanest long-term engineering position is therefore to decouple:

```text
OWL language semantics / syntax
        ↓
public normative specifications
        ↓
independently authored owlapi-js
        ↓
behavioural verification
        ↓
pinned Java OWLAPI reference harness
```

from the legacy path:

```text
Java OWLAPI implementation source
        ↓
historical Java → JavaScript port
        ↓
legacy WebVOWL parser
```

The second path can remain useful temporarily for characterization and regression comparison, but it should not be the default provenance path of the standalone core.

This strategy remains correct after selecting `AGPL-3.0-only`. Strong copyleft
is a project-governance choice, not an obligation forced by avoidable
source-code derivation. The same provenance boundary preserves confidence that
the project has authority to make that choice and preserves whatever later
licensing options its copyright and contribution arrangements actually permit.

### 22.2 Non-negotiable independent-implementation policy

For new `owlapi-js` production code:

1. **Implement language semantics from normative/public specifications.** For OWL 2 constructs and mappings, use the W3C structural specification, concrete-syntax specifications and OWL↔RDF mapping as primary sources.
2. **Use public syntax specifications/documentation for non-W3C dialects where available.** For Manchester, DL and KRSS-family compatibility, prefer published/public grammar and syntax documentation.
3. **Use Java OWLAPI as a black-box behavioural compatibility oracle.** Execute the pinned reference implementation on focused fixtures and compare structural results, accepted/rejected inputs, public API behaviour, parser/format identity and observable diagnostics.
4. **Do not mechanically port or translate OWLAPI implementation source.** New production modules must not be written by translating Java algorithms, branch structure, parser handlers or implementation comments into JavaScript.
5. **Do not make Java OWLAPI a runtime dependency.** Any Java reference tooling belongs in development/test infrastructure only and must be clearly separated from the published browser/Node runtime dependency graph.
6. **Keep compatibility facts project-owned.** Encode discovered behaviour in fixtures, canonical snapshots, parity matrices and concise compatibility notes written in the project's own words.
7. **Treat API compatibility and implementation provenance as separate concerns.** `owlapi-js` may intentionally expose familiar OWLAPI-compatible concepts/method names while implementing their behaviour independently.
8. **Keep third-party standards parsers behind adapters.** Their licences remain their own; the dependency-governance policy in §21.7 determines whether they are acceptable for the production dependency graph.

If an implementer believes that consulting Java OWLAPI implementation source is necessary to resolve a compatibility question, first attempt to answer it with the normative/public specification, Javadocs/API documentation and a black-box differential fixture. If source inspection is still required, record it as a **compatibility/provenance research activity** and do not copy or translate the implementation into production code.

### 22.2.1 Reference implementations other than OWLAPI

The policy above is written for OWLAPI because `owlapi-js` is the component it
protects. The project has a **second** reference implementation, and the rules
that apply to it are not identical. This section states them, because the
difference is easy to get wrong in both directions — treating OWL2VOWL as
forbidden when it is not, or treating it as freely portable when the project's
independence policy still applies.

#### Which reference governs which component

| Component | Reference implementation | Normative authority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `owlapi-js` | Java OWLAPI 5.5.1 | W3C OWL 2 specifications |
| `VOWLBuilder` (`src/owl2vowl/js/vowlBuilder.js`) | OWL2VOWL 0.3.7 | VOWL 2.0 specification |

`OWL2VOWL` converts an OWLAPI `OWLOntology` into VOWL-JSON. That is precisely
the position `VOWLBuilder` occupies, which is what makes its conversion logic
directly comparable — unlike the now-retired pre-cutover converter recorded in
this repository's history, whose
`convertOntology(subjects, languagesSet, resolver, context, header)` signature
bound it to the legacy parser's private intermediate representation rather than
to an OWL structural model.

#### What differs from the OWLAPI position, and why

Three things differ, and each changes the calculus:

1. **Licence.** OWL2VOWL is MIT (© 2014–2020 Link, Lohmann, Marbach, Wiens).
   Section 22.1's concern — that avoidable source derivation could force the
   project's own licence direction — does not arise. Reuse would be *legally*
   available subject to carrying the copyright and permission notice.
2. **Consumer.** `VOWLBuilder` is WebVOWL-side and is not part of the package
   intended for standalone extraction, so its provenance does not constrain the
   extractable core.
3. **Specification coverage.** VOWL 2.0 specifies the visual notation but not
   the VOWL-JSON serialisation. Where no specification exists, OWL2VOWL's
   behaviour is the only available contract, and deriving from its output is
   unavoidable rather than a shortcut.

None of that repeals the independence policy. The project's decision, recorded
by the repository owner, is **consult and derive**: read the Java to understand
a rule, then implement it independently in the project's own terms.
`VOWLBuilder` therefore remains `A_PROJECT_ORIGINAL`, and no MIT attribution
obligation enters the codebase. Porting or adapting OWL2VOWL source would be
permissible under its licence but is a **separate decision** requiring the
repository owner's approval, a provenance reclassification of the affected
modules, and the MIT notice.

#### Required procedure

Consulting OWL2VOWL source **MUST** follow the same escalation as OWLAPI:

1. Answer the question from the **VOWL 2.0 specification** first, and from the
   W3C OWL 2 specifications where the question is really about OWL semantics
   rather than about visualisation.
2. Failing that, use the **pinned reference outputs** under
   `src/owl2vowl/test/fixtures/java-reference-outputs/` as a black-box oracle.
   Forty-six documents is a large behavioural sample and often settles a
   question outright.
3. Only then read the source, and **record a `compatibilityResearch` entry** in
   `docs/owlapi-js/provenance/provenance.json` carrying `reference`,
   `question`, `publicBasis`, `implementationSourcesInspected`,
   `sourceRevision`, `reason`, `finding`, `productionUse` and `evidence`.
   Record the entry whether or not the finding changed any code: a refuted
   hypothesis is exactly as valuable to the next implementer as a confirmed one,
   and without the record the same source will be read again to reach the same
   dead end.

#### Two failure modes observed in practice

Both of these occurred during Phase 8 and are recorded here so they are not
repeated.

**Reading one method and treating it as the algorithm.** `AbstractConverter`
contains a loop of the shape `for (property in signature) { for
(axioms(property)) { visitor } }`, which reads as though a property with no
axioms can never produce a VOWL entity. It cannot be read in isolation:
`preParsing` has already walked the entire imports closure with an
`OWLOntologyWalker` and an `EntityCreationVisitor`, establishing the entity set
before any axiom-driven phase runs. **Find the orchestration before drawing a
conclusion from any single method**, and prefer a hypothesis that the reference
outputs can falsify.

**Mistaking a harness asymmetry for an engine difference.** The pinned outputs
were generated by running the jar against local files, so any import the run
could not fetch is simply absent from that fixture. `tagont.owl` imports
`http://www.mindswap.org/2003/owl/foaf`, a long-dead URL, and its reference
output accordingly contains almost no FOAF vocabulary — while this project's
`ONTOLOGY_CATALOG` maps that IRI to a local copy and resolves it. The two sides
then convert **different ontologies**, and the resulting difference says nothing
about either engine. Before treating a corpus difference as a conversion
difference, confirm that both sides saw the same import closure.

#### Layering constraint

Nothing learned from OWL2VOWL may influence `owlapi-js`. The library follows the
W3C OWL 2 specifications and must remain unaware of VOWL and of every downstream
consumer; `src/owlapi-js/coreIsolation.architecture.test.js` enforces the
vocabulary half of this automatically. The half no test can enforce is
motivation: a rule added to the parser or the RDF-to-OWL translator *because a
VOWL diagram looked wrong* belongs in `owlapi-js` only if it stands on OWL or
RDF grounds by itself, such that a consumer with no interest in VOWL would want
the same behaviour. If the justification needs VOWL to make sense, the logic
belongs in `VOWLBuilder`. State plainly, in the change that introduces it, when
a VOWL difference is what prompted the investigation.

### 22.3 Authoritative legacy-code provenance dispositions

Before migration implementation begins, Phase 0 **MUST** classify every legacy source module, substantial fragment and other implementation artefact reasonably likely to be reused by `owlapi-js`.

Each item **MUST** have exactly one normative disposition:

```text
REUSE_ALLOWED
REFERENCE_ONLY
REIMPLEMENT
EXCLUDE
REVIEW_EXCEPTION
```

`REUSE_ALLOWED` material may be moved/copied/refactored/adapted subject to applicable licence/notices and the new architecture.

`REFERENCE_ONLY` material may be consulted as historical/behavioural/provenance evidence but **MUST NOT** be copied or mechanically reproduced into new production implementation, including implementation-specific control flow, helper decomposition or private algorithms.

`REIMPLEMENT` means the capability is intentionally retained but the legacy production implementation **MUST** be replaced by independently authored production code derived from approved normative/public evidence and project-owned black-box tests.

`EXCLUDE` means the material does not belong in target `owlapi-js` core and **MUST NOT** be migrated.

`REVIEW_EXCEPTION` is a **blocking** disposition, not provisional reuse permission. Such material **MUST NOT** enter new production code until review changes it to a definitive disposition.

Disposition **MUST** be assigned at the smallest practical unit whose provenance is materially uniform. Mixed-provenance files **MUST NOT** receive blanket `REUSE_ALLOWED` merely because some regions are reusable.

The authoritative provenance inventory **MUST** be machine-readable and record at least stable ID, source path/location, classified scope, provenance category, disposition, known origin, relevant licence/copyright information, evidence, required replacement phase where relevant and review/decision reference where relevant.

Before modifying/migrating legacy material, the active team **MUST** consult and obey its disposition. Teams **MUST NOT** reinterpret provenance locally or change a disposition through a source-code edit alone.

Behavioural compatibility and implementation reuse are separate questions. Required Java OWLAPI/WebVOWL behaviour **MUST** be captured through project-owned fixtures/snapshots/tests rather than implementation copying.

Phase 0 **MUST NOT** complete until every reasonably likely migration artefact has a disposition. A `REVIEW_EXCEPTION` blocking a `REQUIRED_V1` Phase 1 capability **MUST** be resolved before Phase 0 completes; later-phase exceptions **MUST** be resolved before their dependent phase begins.

### 22.4 Independent reimplementation procedure

For each semantic parser/translator component being replaced:

1. **Identify authoritative public behaviour.** Enumerate the relevant syntax productions, structural OWL constructs and normative mapping rules before looking at the replacement code.
2. **Create focused tests first.** Where possible, create minimal fixtures for each production/edge case and record the expected structural result from the specification and/or pinned Java OWLAPI harness.
3. **Record legacy behaviour separately.** If WebVOWL behaves differently, mark the case as a characterized compatibility difference rather than silently treating the legacy output as normative.
4. **Implement against the new structural API.** Write the JavaScript code from the specification, project architecture and tests, not from Java implementation control flow.
5. **Run structural differential verification.** Compare JavaScript output with the Java OWLAPI reference snapshot and investigate divergences explicitly.
6. **Run WebVOWL end-to-end verification.** Confirm that intentional compatibility remains intact and that deliberate semantic corrections are documented/tested.
7. **Record provenance.** The module's provenance record should state its normative/public sources, third-party adapters, reference-oracle version and whether any legacy OWLAPI-derived implementation was replaced.
8. **Remove superseded derived code from the standalone core.** Do not leave an unused but distributed copy of the old port in the package.

For non-W3C syntaxes whose complete compatibility surface is not fully specified publicly, use black-box fixture generation to close the gap. The required behaviour can be learned empirically without reproducing the implementation algorithm that produced it.

### 22.5 Reference harness separation

The Java OWLAPI reference harness should be architecturally isolated, for example under development/test tooling rather than `src/`:

```text
tools/
└── owlapi-reference/
    ├── README.md
    ├── generateStructuralSnapshot.*
    ├── pinned-version metadata
    └── reference-output/
```

Requirements:

- it is not imported by browser/Node production modules;
- it is not bundled into published runtime artifacts;
- its Java dependencies are reported separately from production npm dependencies;
- generated reference snapshots are treated as test evidence, with their provenance documented;
- any upstream licence/notice obligations applicable to the development tooling or redistributed reference artifacts are handled separately and explicitly.

This distinction lets Java OWLAPI remain a powerful compatibility oracle without making it part of the runtime architecture.

### 22.6 Provenance record required for every migrated semantic module

Record at minimum:

- new `owlapi-js` module path;
- legacy WebVOWL source path, if any;
- provenance classification (`A`–`E` above);
- normative/public specifications used;
- public compatibility/API references used;
- pinned Java OWLAPI version used by differential tests;
- focused fixtures/snapshots establishing compatibility;
- third-party parser/library dependencies, if any;
- disposition of any historically OWLAPI-derived implementation (`replaced`, `excluded`, or explicitly retained following legal/licensing review`);
- reviewer/date or commit associated with the provenance decision.

This can live in a machine-readable manifest plus human-readable documentation so that release review does not depend on institutional memory.

### 22.7 Exception policy

The project may later decide that retaining a particular upstream-derived implementation is worthwhile under a compatible licence. That must be an **explicit exception**, not the default migration mechanism.

Any such exception requires:

- identifying the exact upstream material and version;
- reviewing the actual upstream licence/NOTICE obligations;
- recording why independent reimplementation is not being used;
- recording the effect on the project's possible licence choices;
- preserving all required notices/attribution;
- approval through the project's licensing review before publication.

No implementer should infer from an OWLAPI-compatible class/method name, an existing WebVOWL port or a parity TODO that source translation is authorized.

### 22.8 Provenance control makes the selected licence deliberate

The implementation blueprint did **not** choose a licence merely to paper over
historical provenance. It first required an independently authored production
core and a controlled runtime dependency graph, then selected
`AGPL-3.0-only` in §2.12 according to the desired governance/social contract.

This order preserves optionality:

```text
independent implementation + controlled dependencies
                    ↓
          broad licence-choice freedom
                    ↓
       project governance selects AGPL-3.0-only
```

The selected strong reciprocity is therefore intentional rather than dictated
by avoidable dependence on Java OWLAPI implementation terms. A later
more-permissive release is a separate governance act that is possible only to
the extent that the project's copyright and contribution arrangements grant
the necessary authority; it cannot withdraw rights already granted under the
AGPL for an earlier release.

This document is engineering guidance, not legal advice. Before first public release, perform an appropriate licensing review; if a formal legal clean-room conclusion is important, obtain specialist counsel rather than treating this engineering process as a substitute.

## 23. Public API Example

The final WebVOWL call site should become simple:

```javascript
import { OWLManager, StringDocumentSource } from "owlapi";

import { VOWLBuilder } from "./vowlBuilder.js";

export default async function owl2vowl(inputString, options = {}) {
  const manager = OWLManager.createOWLOntologyManager({
    documentLoader: options.documentLoader,
    iriMappers: options.iriMappers,
  });

  const source = new StringDocumentSource(inputString, {
    documentIRI: options.documentIRI,
    contentType: options.contentType,
    fileName: options.fileName,
  });

  const ontology = await manager.loadOntologyFromOntologyDocument(
    source,
    options.loaderConfiguration,
  );

  const vowlData = new VOWLBuilder(ontology).build();

  return vowlData;
}
```

The crucial property is what is **absent** from this code:

- no format fallback loop;
- no RDF/XML conversion;
- no DOM handling;
- no raw triples;
- no parser-specific branch;
- no named-graph flattening decision hidden in VOWL code.

---

## 24. Concrete Parser Skeleton

A structural parser should be transaction-first rather than mutating a shared ontology:

```javascript
export class OWLFunctionalSyntaxOWLParser {
  parse(source, transaction, configuration) {
    const lexer = new FunctionalLexer(source.getText(), configuration);
    const parser = new FunctionalParser({
      lexer,
      dataFactory: transaction.getOWLDataFactory(),
      configuration,
      documentIRI: source.getDocumentIRI(),
    });

    const parsed = parser.parseOntology();

    transaction.setOntologyID(parsed.ontologyID);
    transaction.addImportsDeclarations(parsed.imports);
    transaction.addAnnotations(parsed.annotations);
    transaction.addAxioms(parsed.axioms);
    transaction.setDocumentFormat(parsed.format);

    return parsed.format;
  }
}
```

The exact transaction API is illustrative; the invariant is normative: candidate parsing occurs against isolated state and commits only after successful candidate acceptance.

### 24.1 Parse transaction/builder

Every parser candidate **MUST** write into an isolated parse transaction/builder. Ontology axioms, manager registration, imports and document context are committed only after the candidate returns `SUCCESS` and is accepted.

On `ParserMismatchError`, recognized-format failure or any fatal failure, the transaction **MUST** be discarded and shared state **MUST** remain observationally unchanged.

A parser **MUST NOT** mutate a manager-owned ontology incrementally and then rely on rollback cleanup after failure; isolation-before-commit is the normative model.

---

## 25. RDF Parser Skeleton

```javascript
export class RdfOntologyParser {
  constructor({ rdfDatasetParser, rdfToOwlTranslator }) {
    this.rdfDatasetParser = rdfDatasetParser;
    this.rdfToOwlTranslator = rdfToOwlTranslator;
  }

  async parse(source, transaction, configuration) {
    const { dataset, formatMetadata } = await this.rdfDatasetParser.parse(
      source,
      configuration,
    );

    // Adapter preserves the complete dataset first; policy is applied only
    // after RDF normalization and before RDF→OWL reconstruction.
    const graph = selectOntologyGraph(dataset, {
      policy: configuration.rdfDatasetGraphPolicy,
      selectedGraph: configuration.selectedGraph,
      documentContext: transaction.getDocumentContext(),
    });

    this.rdfToOwlTranslator.translateInto(graph, transaction, {
      configuration,
      documentIRI: source.getDocumentIRI(),
    });

    transaction.setDocumentFormat(formatMetadata);
    return formatMetadata;
  }
}
```

The syntax adapter and OWL interpreter are deliberately separate components. RDF syntax conformance is tested at the RDF/JS dataset boundary; OWL reconstruction is tested independently. The transaction is committed only after successful candidate acceptance.

## 27. Risks and Mitigations

### 27.1 Risk: scope expands into full OWLAPI recreation

**Mitigation:** define initial feature parity by actual WebVOWL requirements and a construct matrix. Keep reasoners, profiles, storers and large utility APIs out of the initial milestone.

### 27.2 Risk: structural object count increases memory

A rich object model can allocate more objects than a flat triple store.

**Mitigation:**

- immutability + interning for common entities/IRIs;
- structural deduplication;
- compact class representations;
- lazy derived indexes;
- benchmark against real ontologies;
- do not precompute every possible OWLAPI index.

### 27.3 Risk: RDF→OWL becomes the critical path

**Mitigation:** migrate native syntaxes first and retain legacy RDF path until parity. Implement only construct coverage needed by the current RDF corpus, then expand.

### 27.4 Risk: parser parity and standards correctness diverge

Java OWLAPI sometimes contains implementation-specific recovery behaviour beyond the W3C grammar.

**Mitigation:** distinguish:

```text
Normative requirement → W3C specification wins
Compatibility behaviour → Java OWLAPI is primary oracle
WebVOWL legacy quirk → preserve only if required/intentional
```

Document deliberate deviations.

### 27.5 Risk: parser dependency governance, supply-chain surface and bundle size

A universal parser aggregator can create unnecessary transitive dependencies and concentrate core behaviour in a small-maintainer project. Conversely, selecting a larger institutionally backed framework purely for governance can import substantial unused runtime machinery.

**Mitigation:** depend directly on narrowly scoped format implementations; isolate each behind `RdfSyntaxAdapter`; pin and audit versions; run standards suites in local CI; measure Vite output; dynamically import genuinely optional formats where justified; record bus-factor/governance assessments; and preserve at least one credible replacement path for every parser adapter. Do not write home-grown RDF syntax parsers merely to avoid third-party risk.

### 27.6 Risk: circular module dependencies in object model

OWL expressions/axioms reference many object categories.

**Mitigation:** central factory and canonical `kind` taxonomy, careful dependency direction, documentation-only JSDoc where useful, and direct internal imports that avoid barrel-induced cycles.

### 27.7 Risk: source-order expectations

OWL structural sets do not semantically preserve order, but legacy visualization/tests may accidentally depend on parse order.

**Mitigation:** identify these dependencies explicitly. If deterministic presentation ordering is needed, sort at the VOWL/output layer; do not corrupt OWL structural equality to preserve incidental source order.

---

### 27.8 Risk: behavioural parity work accidentally becomes source-code derivation

A compatibility project naturally encourages developers to inspect the reference implementation. Without an explicit boundary, “make JS behave like OWLAPI” can drift into Java-to-JavaScript translation, reducing licence-choice independence and reintroducing Java-specific implementation structure.

**Mitigation:** enforce §22 as a migration invariant: specifications/public documentation define the implementation; the pinned Java OWLAPI harness supplies black-box behavioural evidence; historically OWLAPI-derived WebVOWL code is characterized then replaced; any exception is explicit and reviewed.

### 27.9 Risk: violating the fixed sequential ingestion WIP lock

**Risk:** teams begin a later parser/adapter while the current ingestion migration is still producing/institutionalizing lessons, causing duplicated discovery, divergent contracts and avoidable rework.

**Mitigation:** §17 explicitly enumerates the complete v1 WIP-locked ingestion sequence. Only one major ontology-ingestion migration is active at a time. Preparatory evidence/fixture work may proceed, but production semantics of later ingestion phases **MUST** wait. There is no automatic transition to parallel parser migrations.

### 27.10 Risk: the lessons repository becomes a second oversized specification

An append-only archive can eventually recreate the same cognitive-load problem it was intended to solve. Teams may read stale or contradictory advice, or stop consulting the repository altogether.

**Mitigation:** separate immutable-ish historical lesson records from the continuously curated current playbook; tag lesson applicability; retire superseded playbook guidance; promote important lessons into tests/contracts/ADRs; keep the playbook small enough to be a practical pre-flight document for the next migration.

### 27.11 Risk: the `owlapi` namespace is unavailable or confused with its prior use

**Risk:** the absence of live npm versions is mistaken for publishing authority,
an overlooked immutable coordinate conflicts with the planned release, or a
consumer using an exceptionally broad range such as `*` receives an unrelated
OWL implementation without understanding the identity change.

**Mitigation:** publish only the genuine reviewed `0.1.0-alpha.0` under `next`;
preserve the first authenticated write result; escalate a namespace failure
rather than silently renaming; never reuse the seven immutable historical exact
coordinates; and keep `latest` unset until production acceptance. Before
`0.1.0`, refresh the §2.10.1 registry identity and coordinate evidence. The
README and npm-rendered metadata disclose that exact old pins remain unavailable
and that the project is unrelated to the former package. Ordinary former 1.x and
2.x ranges cannot resolve a 0.x release; exceptionally broad ranges remain a
documented residual identity risk. A comprehensive range audit is required only
when a separately authorized post-zero promotion considers a coordinate that
former ranges could select.

### 27.12 Risk: WebVOWL bypasses the package it is meant to validate

**Risk:** repository-local relative imports or resolver aliases let WebVOWL use
files that are absent from the `exports` map or packed artefact. Application
tests/builds remain green while an external `owlapi` consumer fails, and private
module paths become accidental dependencies that prevent safe refactoring.

**Mitigation:** declare `owlapi` as a WebVOWL production dependency; route every
WebVOWL import and test through the applicable `owlapi`, `owlapi/apibinding`,
`owlapi/model`, `owlapi/io`, or `owlapi/formats` entry point; reject
`owlapi/rdf`, relative/deep imports and resolver aliases with an architecture
test; run the ordinary Jest/Vite workflows after a clean exact-registry install;
and retain separate candidate-tarball and registry-consumer gates for
packaged-file completeness.

### 27.13 Risk: release scope expansion hides future semantic work inside packaging

**Risk:** publication exposes a desired future consumer, so Phase 19 or the
production-release phase adds nominal mutation, merger or storer APIs without the
design, parity, conformance and round-trip evidence those capabilities require.
The release boundary becomes unreviewable and the resulting API becomes
technical debt before the package has its first externally exercised production contract.

**Mitigation:** freeze `0.1.0-alpha.0` and `0.1.0` to the accepted Phase 18
capability families plus test-proven corrections; make follow-on capabilities
explicit in package metadata; prohibit nominal/stub exports; and implement the
entire query/mutation/merge/store slice under the separate
`ontology-lifecycle-capability-implementation-plan.md`. Production `0.1.0` is blocked by
production-package and WebVOWL evidence, not by unrelated feature breadth.

### 27.14 Risk: contribution terms silently eliminate later licensing options

**Risk:** the project assumes that beginning under `AGPL-3.0-only` means it can
always issue a future permissive release, then accepts contributions whose
authors granted only the AGPL rights available to every recipient. A later
licence change would require locating and obtaining consent from every affected
copyright holder, or excluding and independently replacing their work.

**Mitigation:** fix and publish the contributor-rights policy before accepting
outside package contributions. Phase 19 publishes the explicit
`AGPL-3.0-only` inbound=outbound baseline but does not build a speculative CLA
before an external copyrightable contribution exists. Before the first such
contribution is merged, the §2.14.1 gate must either confirm pure
inbound=outbound and consciously accept contributor-by-contributor relicensing,
or adopt and obtain a reviewed contributor-retained CLA. Make the inbound terms
conspicuous, record the actual rights holder and authority for each accepted
contribution, and never describe relicensing as a guaranteed project power
unless the actual grants support it. Any later licence change is separately
approved, versioned and audited, and cannot revoke the terms of an already
published AGPL release.

### 27.15 Risk: confusing project stewardship, copyright and operational custody

**Risk:** package metadata or notices name HADDEN INDUSTRIES LTD as copyright
owner/licensor merely because it stewards the repository, or assume that a
copyright assignment would by itself preserve the exact GitHub and npm release
paths. The former misstates present title; the latter leaves a practical
single-account bus factor unresolved. Conversely, treating personal copyright
as a publication blocker would add an unnecessary legal gate even though
published AGPL grants and copyright succession remain available.

**Treatment:** identify Maksym Shostak as owner of his contributions until an
optional written assignment actually takes effect; identify HADDEN INDUSTRIES
LTD separately as project steward with its complete registered-company wording;
verify the retained tarball's rights inventory; and use his individually
authenticated GitHub/npm accounts, MFA, least privilege, trusted publishing and
a rehearsed release/recovery runbook. This plan knowingly accepts that those
controls do not remove the single-person availability and account-recovery risk;
adding another human custodian is post-plan governance. Keep personal estate
planning external to the release and never treat a company registration, npm
organization or repository setting as evidence of copyright transfer or human
redundancy.

### 27.16 Risk: extraction either imports unrelated history or erases lineage

**Risk:** a whole-repository GitHub fork makes `owlapi` appear to be a WebVOWL
variant and imports years of unrelated UI/application history, while a fresh
snapshot or simplistic path copy discards the actual migration authorship and
evolution. Interleaved or mixed commits can also leak UI/UX changes into the
package history or lose package-relevant changes during replay.

**Mitigation:** create an independent repository; freeze the original mixed
branch; classify every commit in a machine-readable partition manifest; split
mixed commits by reviewed change; perform the rewrite in a disposable clone;
retain original metadata and an original-to-rewritten commit map; prove
path-normalized file-hash equivalence at handoff; reconstruct UI/UX work on a
separate branch in `Hadden-Industries/webvowl`; and keep the original branch
until both histories pass tests and complete accounting.

### 27.17 Risk: redundant entry metadata or false side-effect claims create production-only package failures

**Risk:** `main`, `browser`, conditional/pattern exports or filesystem aliases
give different tools different public surfaces, while an unverified
`sideEffects: false` lets optimized bundlers discard required initialization.
Node/package tests can remain green even though a real application resolves a
different target or loses behaviour only in production.

**Mitigation:** make the exact §2.43 `exports` object the sole entry authority;
reject every alternate/deep/metadata path; require one canonical binding
identity; instrument the complete package-owned import closure; execute used
and unused production tree-shaking fixtures; and treat either mismatch as a
release-blocking source/manifest defect under §2.44.

### 27.18 Risk: a reference CDN becomes an undeclared runtime or CI authority

**Risk:** native-import-map evidence depends directly on a live third-party
provider, so an outage is confused with a package defect, a provider rewrite is
accepted without integrity checking, or documentation accidentally implies that
every `owlapi` application must trust one CDN.

**Mitigation:** exact-pin the §2.46 generator/configuration, include integrity
metadata, verify the public URLs, hydrate and check every module, run the
required engines against an untransformed ephemeral local mirror, keep provider
bytes out of package source, and state that `jspm.io` is a replaceable reference
whose graph may be application-hosted.

### 27.19 Risk: release-tool or evidence-schema drift produces authoritative-looking false evidence

**Risk:** a floating or host-global npm/SBOM/validator/browser/bundler/release
tool silently changes lockfile, component classification, browser evidence,
package bytes or accepted record fields; development packages enter the SBOM;
or an unvalidated JSON record is attached immutably and later treated as proof.

**Mitigation:** enforce the complete exact §2.54 baseline through local npm
scripts and checksum/digest-verified external tools; keep the CycloneDX binary
in a clean tool workspace and its production-only subject in another; reconcile
the generated graph independently with npm, lockfile and pack inventory;
validate closed versioned Draft 2020-12 evidence with registered standard
formats before use; reject remote `npx` and runner-global authority; and review
every tool update plus lock/evidence/browser/bundle output diff as a separate
configuration/dependency change.

### 27.20 Risk: release reproducibility is confused with forcing a library consumer's transitive tree

**Risk:** a shrinkwrap or bundled dependency set makes one installation look
deterministic while preventing ordinary deduplication/security updates,
misrepresenting private parser engines as consumer-controlled peers or becoming
ineffective under a newer npm resolver. Conversely, testing only the repository
lockfile misses a consumer-visible transitive resolution failure.

**Mitigation:** implement §2.48: publish ordinary exact direct dependencies and
no shrinkwrap/bundle/peer/optional/override authority; retain the source lockfile
only for reviewed CI/release construction; test and record both locked and fresh
lockless consumer graphs; and run the read-only weekly `owlapi@latest` monitor
without automatic mutation or publication.

### 27.21 Risk: project-specific package tests encode the same mistaken assumption as the manifest

**Risk:** export/packlist governance tests pass because they reproduce the
project's design, while a broadly used Node/bundler resolver rule still rejects
or misinterprets the packed package.

**Mitigation:** run local exact `publint@0.3.24` in strict mode against the actual
retained tarball and registry-downloaded bytes; retain suggestions for review;
and allow only exact-rule, exact-tool, evidence-backed, expiring warning
exceptions without replacing the project's stronger semantic gates.

### 27.22 Risk: one NOTICE file falsely claims to cover two different distributions

**Risk:** dependency manifest strings are treated as complete licence evidence,
all external dependency licences are dumped indiscriminately into the package,
or WebVOWL assumes that `owlapi`'s notice covers third-party code physically
embedded into the application bundle.

**Mitigation:** use the §2.50 schema-validated, human-reviewed material registry;
hash and inspect actual licence/notice files; render the package `NOTICE` only
for its real tarball scope and boundary; and independently reconcile WebVOWL's
emitted bundle with its deployment-scope inventory and notices.

### 27.23 Risk: a provenance badge or aggregate count is accepted for the wrong package

**Risk:** the npm page looks provenanced or `npm audit signatures` reports some
verified attestations, but the evidence belongs to a dependency, different
version, source repository or workflow and is nevertheless recorded as proof of
the published `owlapi` coordinate.

**Mitigation:** implement §2.51 with the exact approved npm patch and attestation
JSON; identify the root coordinate; validate registry signature, provenance and
publish attestations, subject digest, case-sensitive source/workflow/tag/commit
identity and transparency evidence; and retain the normalized root result.

### 27.24 Risk: an immutable-release badge hides an unverified or mismatched asset

**Risk:** the GitHub release is marked immutable but one asset was omitted from
verification, the checksum file is malformed or covers different bytes, the
release evidence was attached later than the reviewed checksums, or the tag/
source binding is assumed rather than independently verified.

**Mitigation:** require the exact §2.52 two-entry checksum format; verify GitHub
CLI `2.98.0` against its official checksum; download all four assets in a fresh job; verify the release
and each asset separately; validate checksums/evidence schema; independently
verify the authorized SSH-signed tag/commit; and preserve every resulting
identity in the append-only release record.

### 27.25 Risk: staged approval promotes bytes other than the reviewed tarball

**Risk:** a workflow stages a directory, repacks after review, targets the wrong
tag or produces a candidate whose metadata looks correct while its bytes differ
from the retained tarball that passed the release gates. An approver who reviews
only a workflow URL or stage summary could then promote the wrong immutable
version.

**Mitigation:** permit only `npm stage publish` of the retained tarball; record
the stage ID; require an interactively authenticated maintainer to view and
download that exact stage; compare its SHA-256 byte for byte with the retained
digest; rerun the required candidate gates; bind the approval record to stage,
coordinate, tag, source and digest; and reject rather than repair every mismatch
before interactive 2FA approval under §2.53.

### 27.26 Risk: workflow convenience collapses untrusted, npm and repository-write boundaries

**Risk:** one broadly privileged workflow or cross-workflow artefact promotion
lets pull-request code, a poisoned cache, an unrelated run or one compromised
Action reach npm OIDC, the bootstrap token, GitHub-release writes or issue-write
authority. A cancellation race can also interrupt a release after external state
was created and allow a later run to proceed from an ambiguous candidate.

**Mitigation:** implement the exact §2.55 four-workflow topology; deny root token
permissions; avoid `pull_request_target` and privileged `workflow_run`; keep the
complete manually dispatched late-tag candidate chain within one cache-free
`release.yml` run;
hash every same-run artefact transfer; separate npm OIDC, GitHub-release write
and issue-report jobs; serialize releases without cancellation; restrict allowed
Actions; require full-SHA pins; and record the effective workflow/job/artefact
identities in release evidence.

### 27.27 Risk: an immutable Action pin preserves unsafe defaults as faithfully as safe ones

**Risk:** a full commit SHA prevents upstream tag movement, but does not make the
selected Action, role or inputs least-privilege. Checkout can persist a write-
capable credential, setup-node can enable dependency caching implicitly from
package metadata, broad artefact selectors can retrieve the wrong candidate,
overwrite/merge behavior can hide an unexpected file, and a convenience Action
can quietly add another network, token or supply-chain authority. A dependency-
review job with write/comment or licence policy outside the approved release
gate can likewise expand scope while appearing security-oriented.

**Mitigation:** enforce the complete §2.56 contract as one review unit: exactly
five official Action repositories at the recorded tag-to-SHA mappings; explicit
checkout depth/tag/credential inputs per role; exact Node patches with both
setup-node cache switches disabled; no steady-state registry/token setup;
candidate upload/download by immutable artefact ID with closed inventories,
independent checksums and non-merging/non-overwriting behavior; and a read-only,
runtime-vulnerability-only dependency review. Review every Action upgrade as an
executable policy change—including defaults, inputs, outputs, runtime and
permissions—not as a mechanical SHA refresh.

### 27.28 Risk: a moving runner image or Linux-only gate masquerades as a portable deterministic build

**Risk:** `*-latest` can change OS generation, while even a versioned hosted
label receives new image builds and preinstalled software. Treating either as an
immutable environment makes later evidence irreproducible. Consuming an image's
ambient Node/browser/CLI can silently change release behavior, and a Linux-only
test can miss Windows path/case/encoding or macOS/arm64 assumptions even though
the manifest publishes no OS exclusion. Unspecified shell behavior can also let
a failing pipeline segment pass or make equivalent workflow text behave
differently on Windows.

**Mitigation:** implement §2.57: use only the three explicit GA labels and verify
their expected architectures; let Ubuntu 24.04 x64 alone build/publish; run the
complete Ubuntu Node matrix plus the four blocking Windows/macOS installed-
tarball lanes and three one-worker Ubuntu Playwright jobs; select Bash or
PowerShell Core explicitly while keeping policy in cross-platform Node scripts;
record every job's actual image/OS/kernel/runtime identity; and obtain every
release tool independently of the runner image. Treat image builds as observed
mutable evidence and a resulting required failure as a blocker, not as permission
to weaken the matrix or swap silently to a container/self-hosted runner.

### 27.29 Risk: skipped work appears green or an automatic retry duplicates external state

**Risk:** branch protection over volatile matrix names can overlook a newly
added lane, while a skipped, cancelled or timed-out prerequisite may be hidden
by `always()`, `continue-on-error`, fail-fast cancellation or a report adapter
that exits successfully. Unbounded network retries can turn an outage into a
multi-hour release, and blindly retrying a publish, stage approval, tag change,
asset upload or issue mutation after an ambiguous response can create duplicate
or contradictory external state. A non-cancelling release group without a
preserved pending queue can also silently displace an older signed tag.

**Mitigation:** implement §2.58 as one fail-closed contract: governance-verify
the complete mandatory-job inventory behind stable `CI / required` and
`Release / qualified` aggregates; require success—not skip/cancel/timeout—from
every prerequisite; disable required-matrix fail-fast and allow-failure paths;
set the exact job/step deadlines; preserve every release tag with
`queue: max`; coalesce only observational schedules; retry only bounded
idempotent reads; and give external writes one automatic attempt followed by
exact read-only reconciliation and renewed authorization for any genuinely new
mutation.

### 27.30 Risk: fork code or attacker-controlled metadata crosses a credential or workflow-command boundary

**Risk:** an external pull request can alter scripts, dependencies, tests and
workflow helpers even when `.github/workflows/` itself looks harmless. Running
that tree automatically wastes the expensive matrix and, in a privileged event,
can exfiltrate secrets or mutate the repository. Direct interpolation of a PR
title/ref or remote response into `run:` can become shell source; raw writes to
workflow command files can forge outputs/environment; a fork artefact promoted
into release can become a supply-chain input. Context dumps, tracing and faith
in automatic masking can also turn a diagnostic into a credential incident.

**Mitigation:** implement §2.59: require per-run approval for every external
contributor after inspecting all executable inputs; run fork and Dependabot code
only in no-secret/no-OIDC/no-environment/read-only `pull_request` CI; quarantine
its artefacts to unprivileged jobs in that run; validate contributor/external
values as data through closed project-owned helpers; forbid raw workflow-command
output and sensitive context/trace logging; scan retained outputs; and revoke/
rotate on suspected exposure regardless of displayed masking.

### 27.31 Risk: an immutable version tag is consumed before release-only qualification discovers a correctable defect

**Risk:** a tag-push-triggered workflow must create `v<version>` before it can
exercise release-only packaging, browser, WebVOWL, SBOM, stage and registry
paths. If a deterministic defect then requires a corrected commit, preserving
the tag makes the planned npm version unpublishable from the correction, while
moving/deleting the tag destroys the source identity consumers may already have
observed. For the planned `v0.1.0`, that would silently force a choice between
the exact terminal version and immutable release history.

**Mitigation:** implement §2.60's manually dispatched late-tag state machine.
Capture the accepted protected-`main` commit, complete all deterministic gates,
and for steady-state releases stage/download/byte-verify the retained tarball
before a human creates the canonical tag. Verify that later tag before draft or
public-promotion authority. Correct freely through review while no tag exists;
after the tag, reconcile unchanged-input failures but abandon rather than move
the version if a deterministic correction is required. Preserve a failed-attempt
record and run the next exact version through the complete gate.

### 27.32 Risk: an implicit human hand-off races the workflow or occupies a runner

**Risk:** after qualification or stage creation, an immediately scheduled tag-
verification job can run before the human finishes candidate review and pushes
the tag. A shell polling loop instead consumes hosted-runner time, introduces an
arbitrary deadline and supplies no durable authenticated acknowledgement that
the human completed the prerequisite. Splitting continuation into another
workflow weakens the approved same-run artefact boundary.

**Mitigation:** implement §2.61's single no-authority `release-manual`
environment with `deployment: false`. Its required review pauses the job before
runner allocation; its first gate follows tag creation and precedes draft
mutation, while its second staged-release gate follows interactive 2FA promotion
and precedes public verification. Retain GitHub's authenticated run-review
history with the gate job timeline, keep all mutation authority in
`npm-release`/separate write jobs and reconcile rejected, premature or expired
gates without blind retry or bespoke tag-message authority.

## 28. Scope: Initial Release vs Future Work

### 28.1 `owlapi@0.1.0-alpha.0` package target

**In scope:**

- W3C-faithful structural objects needed by WebVOWL;
- `OWLDataFactory`;
- `OWLOntology` and manager/loading essentials;
- existing OWL-native parser families, including distinct KRSS1 and KRSS2 behavior;
- the Phase 17 original KRSS/KRSS1 parser, corpus-provenance register, dialect fixtures and shared KRSS core with separate public adapters;
- RDF/JS parser boundary;
- RDF→OWL coverage required for current corpus;
- OWL→RDF mapping for supported structural objects;
- imports/document resolver abstractions;
- diagnostics/resource policies;
- browser + Node support;
- high-quality public API and semantic documentation;
- WebVOWL as a declared production consumer using only `owlapi`,
  `owlapi/apibinding`, `owlapi/model`, `owlapi/io`, and `owlapi/formats`, with
  no relative source-tree reach-in or package-bypassing resolver alias;
- the unscoped npm identity `owlapi` with only the five §2.10.4 public entry
  points; and
- a genuine `0.1.0-alpha.0` release under `next` with the exact Phase 18
  capability freeze in §2.11.

### 28.2 Explicitly not required for `0.1.0-alpha.0`

- **Notation3 (N3) language ingestion** — `DEFERRED`; N3.js is used only for Turtle, TriG, N-Triples and N-Quads in v1.

- description-logic reasoner implementation;
- complete reasoner API parity;
- every OWLAPI utility/search helper;
- ontology change listeners/events unless WebVOWL needs them;
- profiles/checkers unless needed for correctness diagnostics;
- public closure-query/materialization, mutation, merger, save and concrete
  storer APIs—the coherent follow-on capability programme, not packaging or
  production-release work;
- OBO parser unless current scope requires it;
- SWRL completeness unless test corpus requires it;
- byte-for-byte serializer parity with Java OWLAPI.

### 28.3 Production-recommended `0.1.0` target

Production-recommended `0.1.0` packages the accepted ingestion/model surface rather than
adding a second semantic programme. It requires the §2.10.4 Public API Surface
Registry and the §17.27 release-candidate, deterministic-artefact,
production-publication, package-identity/coordinate and exact-registry WebVOWL gates.
Test-proven defect, security, portability, diagnostic, documentation and
packaging corrections are permitted; new parser, mutation, merger, storage or
public-workflow families are deferred to
`ontology-lifecycle-capability-implementation-plan.md`.

The production cutover remains exactly `0.1.0` unless either §2.60's
extraordinary post-tag/prepublication deterministic-abandonment branch makes the
next available same-surface patch the first production release, or that already-published
coordinate fails mandatory post-publication verification. Only those two
explicit branches may substitute a fully gated patch; that patch corrects the
same frozen surface and does not expand this scope.

Production publication also changes the reviewed publish channel from `next`
to `latest` under §2.38 while retaining the exact §2.39 discovery metadata. Its
release is durable through the §2.40 evidence asset/repository index, accepted
only with the §2.41 source/secret-scanning state and required to preserve the
§2.42 zero-telemetry contract. It retains the sole §2.43 exports map,
§2.44 import purity/`sideEffects: false`, §2.45 exact npm `devEngines` tool
identity, §2.46 JSPM reference-map contract and §2.47 validated CycloneDX/
Draft 2020-12 evidence toolchain proven by the accepted release candidate. It
also retains §2.48 ordinary dependency resolution and dual-graph evidence,
§2.49 strict independent tarball lint, §2.50 distribution-scoped material/
notice governance, §2.51 exact npm root-attestation proof and §2.52 fresh
immutable-release/per-asset verification. Staged publication remains bound to
the retained tarball under §2.53, the release-control toolchain remains exact
and isolated under §2.54, the four trust-separated workflows remain governed by
§2.55, and every selected Action and security-relevant input is revalidated
under §2.56 rather than inherited by assumption from the alpha. The exact
Ubuntu-authoritative/Windows-and-macOS-qualifying runner, shell, browser-host and
image-evidence contract in §2.57 is likewise rerun against the production candidate.
The §2.58 aggregate-check, required-conclusion, timeout, concurrency-queue,
controlled-read-retry and one-attempt external-mutation contract is likewise
rerun and retained as production-release evidence.
The §2.59 per-run external-contributor approval, unprivileged fork/Dependabot
execution, artefact quarantine, validated workflow-data flow and log/secret
hygiene contract also remains part of production repository and release acceptance.
The §2.60 protected-`main` manual dispatch, pre-tag deterministic qualification,
pre-tag staged-byte proof, later immutable tag and failed-attempt/version-
abandonment contract is likewise part of production acceptance rather than optional
release ceremony.

### 28.4 Why internal OWL→RDF belongs in the repository before storers do

`OwlToRdfTranslator` is a semantic mapping layer, not a concrete storer. It
remains rigorously tested internal source because it:

- completes the model boundary;
- enables round-trip tests;
- supports future RDF serializers without coupling to any format;
- mirrors normative OWL architecture.

The follow-on plan adds `RDFXMLStorer` on top of this internal mapping and
RDF/XML serialization. No translator or RDF/JS factory becomes public merely
because a future storer uses it. Turtle and other concrete writer families
remain later optional capabilities.

---

## 29. Definition of Architectural Success

The extraction is successful when all of the following are true:

### Separation

- WebVOWL has no ontology syntax parsing logic.
- the `owlapi` production package has no VOWL concepts.
- `Hadden-Industries/owlapi` is the sole maintained package source; WebVOWL
  retains neither a package copy nor a workspace/submodule/subtree.
- RDF/XML is absent as an internal interchange format.
- WebVOWL imports the core only through the applicable five declared §2.10.4
  package entry points; no `owlapi/rdf`, source-tree reach-in, or resolver alias
  bypasses the package.

### Semantics

- all supported OWL-native syntaxes produce the same structural object model;
- all supported RDF syntaxes pass through a common RDF/JS boundary and shared RDF→OWL interpreter;
- structural equality follows W3C set/list semantics;
- annotations/imports/ontology identity are not lost;
- named graph membership is not silently flattened.

### Compatibility

- current Java differential corpus is green;
- every public binding is classified and documented as a Java analogue,
  JavaScript adaptation, or expressly approved extension;
- paired Java/JavaScript primary-workflow examples pass through the installed
  package;
- WebVOWL output is unchanged except for explicitly approved bug fixes;
- malformed/unsupported input fails explicitly rather than silently losing semantic content.

### Engineering quality

- large input does not cause eager-token OOM;
- parsing/imports have resource and network limits;
- package is native-ESM-first with exactly `owlapi`, `owlapi/apibinding`,
  `owlapi/model`, `owlapi/io`, and `owlapi/formats` exported in the production
  cutover version;
- one unconditional `exports` object is the sole package-entry authority; no
  fallback field, condition, pattern, metadata export, extension alias or deep
  path creates a second public surface;
- the installed runtime is the canonical readable tagged source, with no
  generated `dist/` duplicate, minification, source maps, TypeScript declaration
  surface or automatic install/pack/publish hooks;
- a clean WebVOWL root install, test run and Vite build resolve those specifiers
  through the exact npm-registry production dependency and installed package
  `exports` map;
- parser factories are explicit and tree-shaking-friendly;
- every package-owned production module is import-pure, production tree
  shaking is verified, and `sideEffects: false` is an enforced contract rather
  than an untested optimization;
- import, manager construction and local parsing perform no network request,
  and the package contains no telemetry, analytics, update or diagnostic-upload
  channel;
- tests compare structural/RDF semantics rather than serializer accidents.

### Publication

- a clean consumer can install both the retained alpha/prerelease and, normally,
  production `owlapi@0.1.0` from the public npm registry; solely after a documented
  §2.60 prepublication tag abandonment, the next fully gated same-surface
  coordinate is the first production release instead;
- the npm metadata points exactly to the independent public
  `Hadden-Industries/owlapi` source repository and later trusted publication
  produces verifiable provenance from that repository;
- every installed manifest uses the exact §2.39 description/keywords without
  misleading capability or ceremonial metadata, and its SemVer,
  `publishConfig.tag`, authorized command and observed registry channel agree
  under §2.38;
- every installed manifest has the exact §2.43 exports-only shape,
  §2.44 `sideEffects: false` and §2.45 npm-native `devEngines` value; it has no
  `engines.npm` or top-level `packageManager`, and the release evidence records
  Node `22.23.2`/`24.19.0` and npm `12.0.2` actually used;
- `latest` resolves exactly to the accepted production cutover artefact—normally
  `0.1.0`, the next same-surface patch after an activated §2.60 prepublication
  tag-abandonment branch, or the first corrective patch after §2.33;
  after production verification the now-stale `next` pointer is absent and its
  removal is recorded, while immutable prerelease versions remain installable
  exactly;
- the installed tarball and runtime dependency closure match the reviewed
  release artefact and contain no WebVOWL/reference/test material;
- the installed README/API/changelog/licence/notice/compatibility set is exact,
  version-matched and internally consistent; `API.md` covers every executable
  public binding and no internal value;
- production registry rows distinguish the protected `INITIAL_DEVELOPMENT` and retained
  `DEPRECATED_INITIAL_DEVELOPMENT` surface from `INTERNAL_ONLY` implementation details, and the
  package's version/deprecation practice enforces §2.27;
- the package manifest, package-local licence, packed notices and npm page all
  identify `AGPL-3.0-only`, while the retained-tarball inventory records any
  separately licensed third-party material and the authority to license every
  package-owned file;
- the repository publishes the approved §2.14 inbound=outbound contribution
  policy, its governance test is green, and no external copyrightable
  contribution can cross the first-merge checkpoint by assumption or accident;
- the public README explains the unrelated historical package identity and the
  reason for building `owlapi`, explains its independent relationship to Java
  OWLAPI, states the exact supported Phase 18 alpha surface, explicitly
  places closure/mutation/merger/storage work in the follow-on plan and makes no
  `universal-ontology` materialization claim;
- the history-partition manifest accounts for every original mixed-branch
  commit, the commit map and hash manifests establish the extracted lineage,
  and unrelated UI/UX work lives only in the separately reconstructed WebVOWL
  branch;
- the registry coordinate, source commit, Git tag, integrity, custodian and
  verification evidence are durably recorded through the immutable §2.40
  release-evidence asset and append-only repository hierarchy rather than
  depending on expiring workflow logs;
- the exact `@jspm/generator@2.16.3` §2.46 reference map has complete integrity metadata,
  retrievable reference URLs and a passing locally mirrored three-engine suite
  without becoming package runtime code, and the separate-workspace §2.47
  `@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm@6.0.1` production graph plus Draft 2020-12
  `ajv@8.20.0`/`ajv-formats@3.0.1` records agree with the
  retained package and dependency inventory;
- `main` and `v*` rulesets, squash-only release pull requests, non-mutating
  release automation, exact runtime pins and proposal-only dependency updates
  implement §§2.30–2.32;
- the organization-team access experiment and verified sole
  `MaksymShostak`/`maksymshostak` human custody implement §2.28 without any
  shared npm identity or false multi-person-continuity claim;
- bad-release containment, full/production audit evidence, one-person explicit
  publication approval, SSH signer continuity and structured GitHub intake
  implement §§2.33–2.37;
- channel-consistent publication metadata, honest npm discovery metadata,
  durable release evidence, CodeQL/secret protection and zero telemetry
  implement §§2.38–2.42;
- exact entry metadata, import purity, npm-native source-tool enforcement,
  replaceable reference-map tooling and validated release-artifact schemas
  implement §§2.43–2.47;
- ordinary library dependency resolution plus locked/lockless evidence, strict
  independent tarball lint, distribution-scoped material/notice review, exact
  npm root-attestation validation, fresh per-asset immutable-release proof and
  staged-candidate download/digest binding implement §§2.48–2.53;
- exact local npm-tool versions/scripts, blocking Node/npm patches,
  Playwright-managed browser revisions, standalone Vite fixtures, separated
  SBOM tool/subject workspaces and checksum/digest-pinned external tools
  implement §2.54;
- the exact four-workflow topology, root-denied/job-minimal permissions,
  manually dispatched same-run candidate chain, protected environments, serialized
  non-cancelling releases and full-SHA selected-Action policy implement §2.55;
- exactly the five §2.56 Action tag/SHA pairs are executable, checkout never
  persists credentials, setup-node never creates an implicit dependency cache,
  steady OIDC publication has no checkout/registry/token configuration, the
  three-file candidate travels by immutable artefact ID with independent digest
  and inventory checks, dependency review is read-only and runtime-
  vulnerability-only, and no wrapper/cache/release/attestation Action supplies a
  second authority;
- only `ubuntu-24.04` x64 produces release bytes; the full Ubuntu Node matrix,
  four blocking `windows-2025` x64/`macos-15` arm64 installed-tarball lanes and
  three separate one-worker Ubuntu browser jobs pass; explicit Bash/PowerShell
  Core selection and per-job runner-image records implement §2.57; and no
  moving/preview/slim/larger/self-hosted/container or runner-preinstalled-tool
  path supplies release evidence;
- `main` is protected by the exact GitHub-Actions-owned `CI / required`
  aggregate plus CodeQL, npm authority depends directly on
  `Release / qualified`, and governance proves both aggregate inventories match
  every mandatory job; required matrices finish with honest conclusions, exact
  timeouts and the §2.58 queue policy, while bounded read retries and
  reconciled single-attempt writes prove no skipped/cancelled/timed-out or
  ambiguous operation crossed the publication boundary;
- every external fork run is maintainer-approved only for unprivileged
  execution; external/Dependabot code receives no secret, OIDC, environment or
  write authority; its candidate remains in the same CI run; contributor/
  external metadata crosses only validated data channels; and §2.59 log,
  workflow-command, sanitization and exposure-response controls are enforced;
- `release.yml` accepts only a manual dispatch at the captured protected-`main`
  head, derives the release identity, completes every deterministic gate and the
  steady-state staged-byte proof before the human creates the immutable tag,
  verifies that tag before draft/public promotion, and enforces §2.60's
  append-only abandonment branch rather than moving a tag;
- `release-manual` supplies the same run's no-secret/no-write/no-OIDC,
  `deployment: false` reviewer gates after tag creation and after staged
  promotion; authenticated approval history is retained, no runner polls while
  waiting, and §2.61 recovery never duplicates an external write;
- WebVOWL declares the exact public production cutover version—normally
  `owlapi@0.1.0`, with a same-surface patch permitted only by §2.60 or §2.33—and has removed
  every direct dependency owned only by the extracted package; and
- the follow-on capability plan is linked as future work rather than reported as
  incomplete work in this finished plan.

### Reuse

A non-WebVOWL consumer can do:

```javascript
import { OWLManager } from "owlapi";

const manager = OWLManager.createOWLOntologyManager();
const ontology = await manager.loadOntologyFromOntologyDocument(source);

for (const cls of ontology.getClassesInSignature()) {
  // generic OWL application code
}
```

without importing any VOWL code.

## 30. Implementation Checklist

### Sequential migration / organizational learning

- [ ] Execute exactly one major ontology-ingestion migration at a time for the complete §17 sequence.
- [ ] Complete Definition of Done + mandatory learning gate before beginning the next ingestion migration.
- [ ] Maintain the canonical `parser-migration-playbook.md` plus historical per-migration lesson records.
- [ ] Classify every material finding by applicability and primary disposition.
- [ ] Leave zero unclassified findings, zero unfinished local follow-ups and zero blocking normative proposals at gate closure.
- [ ] Institutionalize reusable lessons into current playbook/tests/contracts/fitness/security/performance checks where applicable.
- [ ] Permit preparatory fixture/research work for later phases, but no future production parser/adapter semantics.
- [ ] Require approved project decision + same-change normative-document updates for sequence, scope, API, shared-contract, dependency, security, provenance, budget or conformance changes.
- [ ] Never introduce a later parallel parser-migration mode.

### Architecture

- [ ] Introduce two canonical IRs: OWL structural model and RDF/JS dataset.
- [ ] Ensure `OWLOntology` stores axioms/metadata, not raw triples.
- [ ] Add `OWLDataFactory`.
- [ ] Add structural equality/key semantics.
- [ ] Add explicit document/dataset context.
- [ ] Build a complete OWLAPI parser/factory/format inventory and classify every entry using exactly `REQUIRED_V1`, `DEFERRED`, `UNSUPPORTED_BY_DESIGN`, or `DELEGATED`.
- [ ] Enforce the §14.10 source-code parity-comment convention for every deferred, partially implemented or unsupported OWLAPI capability.
- [ ] Ensure every `TODO(OWLAPI parity)` / `UNSUPPORTED(OWLAPI parity)` annotation has a matching parity-matrix entry and explicit runtime behaviour; no known gap exists only in planning documentation.
- [ ] Enforce §22 implementation independence: normative/public specifications + project-owned tests define production code; OWLAPI supplies behavioural compatibility evidence only.
- [ ] Keep historically OWLAPI-derived legacy code on the characterization side of the migration seam until it is independently replaced or explicitly reviewed as an exception.

### Native parsers

Execute these as sequential learning batches at their §17 positions. The RDF
foundation, RDF/XML, integration/cutover and Turtle phases now occur between
the completed OWL/XML batch and the later DL/KRSS batches:

- [ ] Functional → structural model; complete learning gate.
- [ ] Manchester → structural model; complete learning gate.
- [ ] OWL/XML → structural model; complete learning gate.
- [ ] DL → structural model; complete learning gate.
- [x] KRSS2/KRSS-family → structural model; complete learning gate.
- [x] Inventory KRSS/KRSS1 as a distinct OWLAPI parser/factory/format compatibility surface.
- [x] Establish the Phase 11 KRSS1/KRSS2 grammar-gap and negative-dialect evidence.
- [x] Implement the distinct `REQUIRED_V1` KRSS1 parser in Phase 17 over only genuinely shared KRSS machinery.
- [x] Record the zero qualifying historical-corpus result and keep all five KRSS fixture/evidence classes distinct.
- [x] Complete explicit/automatic/dialect-ambiguity, Java differential, structural-equivalence, resource, WebVOWL, performance and learning gates before advertising KRSS1.
- [ ] Preserve lazy tokenization.
- [ ] Preserve exact language-tag/token rules.
- [ ] Strict unsupported constructs throw typed errors.

### RDF

Continue the same cumulative ingestion-learning sequence rather than treating RDF adapters as an unrelated programme:

- [ ] Complete the canonical RDF/JS dataset/graph-policy contracts and shared, syntax-independent RDF→OWL translator in Phase 5 using constructed datasets.
- [ ] Implement the direct `rdfxml-streaming-parser` adapter in Phase 6, inheriting XML and RDF lessons and hardening only the shared translator for semantic gaps.
- [ ] Introduce the private strict-mode N3.js implementation plus Turtle only in Phase 9; conditionally load it and establish measured streaming/yield behavior.
- [ ] Keep N3 language ingestion `DEFERRED` and enforce focused Notation3-negative tests.
- [ ] Add the remaining N3.js-backed formats independently as N-Triples, N-Quads and TriG in Phases 12, 13 and 14.
- [ ] Implement Digital Bazaar `jsonld.js` in Phase 15 with a restricted/injected document loader and no N-Quads string round-trip.
- [ ] Keep all parser-specific types/errors/configuration behind `RdfSyntaxAdapter`.
- [ ] Record dependency governance metadata and execute the exact pinned conformance manifests in CI.
- [ ] Preserve graph field.
- [ ] Implement exact `rdfDatasetGraphPolicy` values: `requireSingleGraph`, `defaultGraphOnly`, `selectGraph`, `merge`.
- [ ] Implement RDF-list decoder.
- [ ] Keep RDF→OWL semantic reconstruction in one shared translator; never patch a syntax adapter with private OWL mapping rules.
- [x] Implement the shared OWL→RDF translator in Phase 16.
- [x] Remove the RDF/XML internal serializer with the retained legacy pipeline in Phase 18.

### Manager / I/O

- [ ] Explicit parser registry descriptors.
- [ ] Immutable loader configuration.
- [ ] String document source.
- [ ] Generic document loader protocol.
- [ ] IRI mapper protocol.
- [ ] Import closure/cycle handling.
- [ ] Exact missing-import strategies: `throw` and `diagnostic`.
- [ ] `AbortSignal` support where applicable.

### WebVOWL

- [x] Create `VOWLBuilder` consuming `OWLOntology` and producing VOWL-JSON-compatible structures without legacy converter/exporter imports.
- [x] Move WebVOWL catalog/path resolver to injected core interfaces.
- [x] Remove XML/RDF syntax awareness from VOWL conversion.
- [x] Exercise the new path in the development app in Phase 7, then rewire the existing production entry in Phase 8.
- [x] After Phase 8, enforce zero production import/bundle reachability to the legacy parser/converter/exporter path and no runtime fallback.
- [x] Leave legacy files unmoved for characterization/reference until physical deletion in Phase 18.
- [ ] In Phase 19, make WebVOWL a declared production consumer and replace
  every relative/deep core import in its production modules and tests with
  the applicable `owlapi`, `owlapi/apibinding`, `owlapi/model`, `owlapi/io`, or
  `owlapi/formats` entry point; install the exact public-registry version and
  remove the frozen in-repository package staging tree.

### Security

- [ ] Bound sniffing.
- [ ] Harden XML entity expansion.
- [ ] Restrict remote JSON-LD contexts.
- [ ] Restrict remote imports.
- [ ] Establish Phase 0 machine-readable finite resource-safety limits and enforce them through `ResourceLimitError`.
- [ ] Add timeout/redirect/byte limits.
- [ ] Avoid broad parser fallback catches.
- [ ] Enable CodeQL JavaScript default setup/default query suite and require its
  result on `main`; block introduced high/critical findings, prohibit ordinary
  exceptions for reachable critical findings, and validate any bounded source-
  analysis exception separately from dependency advisories.
- [ ] Enable secret scanning and repository push protection; permit only
  reasoned false-positive/non-secret-test-value bypasses and rotate/revoke any
  real exposed credential as an incident.
- [ ] Enforce the zero-telemetry contract: no analytics, crash upload, update
  check, remote configuration or install ping; an installed-package network-
  denial test proves import, manager construction and local representative
  parsing make no request.

### Tests

- [ ] W3C structural-equivalence model tests.
- [ ] parser lexer/unit tests.
- [ ] W3C syntax-translation tests.
- [ ] Java structural differential snapshots.
- [ ] Machine-readable expected-difference manifest using RFC 9535 JSONPath and exact atomic-difference/cardinality rules; zero unmatched/ambiguous/stale required differences.
- [x] OWL→RDF graph equivalence.
- [ ] RDF→OWL round trips.
- [ ] named graph preservation.
- [ ] imports/cycles/missing imports.
- [ ] existing 44-ontology / WebVOWL differential corpus.
- [ ] performance/heap regressions against the pinned benchmark environment and approved thresholds.
- [ ] malformed/adversarial inputs.
- [ ] Independently owned pinned exhaustive conformance scopes for RDF/XML, Turtle, N-Triples, N-Quads and TriG with every upstream test classified `REQUIRED`, `NOT_APPLICABLE` or `EXCLUDED_WITH_REASON` before its phase completes.
- [ ] Pinned exhaustive JSON-LD conformance manifest with every upstream test classified and every `REQUIRED` test passing.
- [ ] adapter replacement contract tests proving parser-specific types do not leak past RDF/JS normalization.
- [ ] strict N3.js format-mode and Notation3-negative tests; never exercise the dependency's permissive default as a supported format.
- [ ] production no-legacy-reachability and explicit unsupported-format/import tests after cutover.

### Packaging / compliance

- [ ] Public manifest is unscoped `owlapi`; the intended first version is
  `0.1.0-alpha.0`, with only §2.60 permitting `0.1.0-alpha.1` after an immutable
  prepublication tag abandonment; `publishConfig` and the explicit authorized command target
  the npm public registry with `next`, never `latest`, and the executable §2.38
  check rejects any version/manifest/request/command disagreement.
- [ ] Every manifest has the exact §2.39 description and keywords, advertises no
  reasoner/knowledge-graph/WebVOWL-specific identity, and omits `funding`,
  `contributors`, author email and invented maintainer metadata until each has a
  genuine approved purpose.
- [ ] Freeze `0.1.0-alpha.0` to the accepted Phase 18 public capability
  snapshot; negative tests prove no nominal follow-on mutation, merger, save or
  storer API and no direct RDF translator/factory export leaked into packaging
  work.
- [ ] Create public `Hadden-Industries/owlapi` as an independent repository—not
  a GitHub fork or mirror—with exact case-consistent package metadata, issues,
  homepage and later trusted-publisher identity.
- [ ] Configure `main` as the sole standing integration branch with squash-only
  pull-request merges, required CI/resolved conversations/linear history,
  `MaksymShostak` administrator coverage and a narrow audited bypass; do not
  require a second-person approving review anywhere in this plan. Any later
  independent-review rule is a separately approved post-plan configuration
  change.
- [ ] Configure a separate `v*` tag ruleset that restricts creation and prevents
  update/deletion; do not create a ceremonial `develop`, release or version
  branch, and do not require every ordinary commit to be signed.
- [ ] Enable GitHub Issues with the six approved structured forms and an
  engineering-focused pull-request template; disable blank issues and
  Discussions, publish no generic support mailbox, and omit `CODEOWNERS` until
  real ownership/review routing exists.
- [ ] Configure 90-day Actions artifact/log retention as diagnostic only, enable
  CodeQL JavaScript default setup/default query suite with required
  high/critical `main` merge protection, and enable secret scanning plus push
  protection without a custom CodeQL workflow or speculative custom patterns.
- [ ] Freeze the original mixed WebVOWL branch; classify every relevant commit
  in the history-partition manifest; split mixed commits; and retain the exact
  original-to-rewritten commit map, extraction commands/tool version and
  path-normalized before/after SHA-256 manifest.
- [ ] Reconstruct unrelated UI/UX work on a separately named branch in
  `Hadden-Industries/webvowl`; keep UI/UX history out of `owlapi` and keep the
  original mixed branch until both rewritten histories pass verification.
- [ ] The root of `Hadden-Industries/owlapi` is the single canonical package
  source; its clean clone/install/test requires no WebVOWL checkout, and
  production import-closure checks prove no WebVOWL path or copied second source
  tree exists.
- [ ] After public alpha verification, WebVOWL root `dependencies` pins
  `"owlapi": "0.1.0-alpha.0"`, has no package workspace/local/Git specifier,
  removes the staging source tree, and records the exact registry tarball and
  integrity in its lockfile.
- [ ] Audit the extracted WebVOWL manifest and remove every direct dependency
  used only by `owlapi`; retain a candidate RDF/JSON-LD/XML dependency only with
  a recorded WebVOWL-owned production or build consumer and re-run clean
  install/test/build gates after the approved manifest/lockfile change.
- [ ] ESM `type: module`.
- [ ] Publish the canonical readable ESM modules directly from the package root;
  no parallel `src/`→`dist/` copy, generated/minified production JavaScript,
  package transpilation or source maps exist in source, exports or tarball.
- [ ] `exports` exposes exactly `owlapi`, `owlapi/apibinding`, `owlapi/model`,
  `owlapi/io`, and `owlapi/formats` through the exact unconditional §2.43
  targets; the manifest has no `main`, `module`, `browser`, condition, wildcard,
  extension alias or `./package.json` export, and installed-consumer tests prove
  every representative alternate/deep path fails.
- [ ] The positive `files` allowlist contains every public facade and transitive
  private runtime module plus exactly README, API, changelog, licence, notice and
  the three approved compatibility documents; executable negatives reject all
  other documentation/development/release artefacts.
- [ ] Keep the six exact foundational packages as ordinary `dependencies`;
  publish no `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, package lock, bundled/bundle, peer, optional
  or override dependency authority; and record both the locked release graph
  and a newly resolved lockless/cache-empty consumer graph under §2.48.
- [ ] No `preinstall`, `install`, `postinstall`, `prepare`, `prepack`,
  `postpack`, `prepublish` or `prepublishOnly` hook can execute during consumer
  installation, packing or publication; the release workflow invokes named
  verification commands explicitly.
- [ ] `docs/compatibility/java-api-surface.json` accounts for every pinned Java
  public package/type with zero unclassified rows; its generated human gap view,
  capability links, `exports` map, source-module paths and packed-package tests
  agree.
- [ ] Every public binding has an approved §2.10.4 classification and Java API
  mapping, one canonical definition in its Java-shaped public namespace and no
  mirrored duplicate beneath `internal/`; explicit facades prevent accidental
  exports, paired primary-workflow examples pass, and duplicate root/subpath
  exports have identical identity.
- [ ] `src/owlapiConsumerBoundary.architecture.test.js` rejects WebVOWL
  retention/reach-in to `src/owlapi-js/`, unexported `owlapi/*` imports,
  dev-only/ranged/non-registry dependency declarations and Vite/Jest aliases
  that bypass package `exports`.
- [ ] Publish the required `sideEffects: false`; instrumented fresh-process
  imports prove the complete package-owned production closure performs no
  registration/I/O/global mutation, and used/unused production-bundler fixtures
  prove tree shaking preserves required behaviour. Fix any failure rather than
  weakening the field.
- [ ] Add npm-native `devEngines` with `runtime.name=node`, no runtime version,
  and exact npm `12.0.2` with `onFail=error`; make every workflow use and record
  that patch, while omitting `engines.npm` and top-level
  `packageManager`.
- [ ] Exact-pin `publint@0.3.24` as the present baseline, or a separately
  reviewed later exact version satisfying the `0.3.24`-or-greater floor; reject
  ranges and floating tags; run its installed binary in strict mode against the
  retained tarball and registry-downloaded bytes; retain suggestions for review;
  and allow only schema-valid exact-rule/tool/version warning exceptions with
  evidence, reviewer and expiry.
- [ ] Native ESM JavaScript build/test/release path with no TypeScript/`tsc`/`checkJs` dependency.
- [ ] JSDoc only where useful for documentation; the manifest has no
  `types`/`typings`, the tarball has no `.d.ts`, and README/package metadata make
  no official TypeScript-support claim for `0.1.0-alpha.0` or `0.1.0`.
- [ ] browser and Node CI covers the exact advertised engine/browser floor;
  ordinary WebVOWL Jest and development/production Vite builds use
  package-installed—not source-relative—imports.
- [ ] Exact-pin `@jspm/generator@2.16.3` as development tooling; generate with
  `jspm.io`, `production`/`browser`/`module` and complete integrity metadata;
  verify reference URLs, hydrate/check the closure, run its untransformed local
  mirror in Chromium/Firefox/WebKit and ship no provider module,
  `es-module-shims` or package-owned universal map.
- [ ] package README identifies the new OWL implementation as unrelated
  to the fully unpublished historical Overwatch package and as independent of
  and not endorsed by Java OWLAPI; documents `npm install owlapi@next`;
  enumerates the Phase 18 alpha surface; accurately describes a JavaScript-
  native compatible subset; and explicitly places the
  `universal-ontology` workflow capabilities in the follow-on plan.
- [ ] README contains the §2.15 “Why `owlapi` exists” section, including the
  practical gap between the project's complete requirements and the adjacent
  implementations evaluated when the work began.
- [ ] README states the §2.42 zero-telemetry/no-automatic-network contract,
  distinguishes caller-enabled imports/context retrieval from telemetry, and
  makes no unnecessary standalone privacy-policy claim for a package that
  collects no data.
- [ ] `API.md` covers every public binding exactly once with public specifier,
  JavaScript call shape, Java OWLAPI relationship, capability/stability status,
  observable semantics, errors and material qualifications; its examples run
  against the retained tarball and it agrees with both machine registries and
  the executable export inventory.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` is human-curated by version and records user-visible
  changes, controlled corrections/deviations, deprecations and compatibility
  consequences rather than raw commits or release-workflow logs.
- [ ] Prepare every public version through a dedicated release pull request that
  synchronizes exact manifest/lockfile version, changelog, API, compatibility
  and evidence; tag only its accepted squash commit, and prove the release
  workflow neither edits tracked files nor authors a version, commit, tag or
  release notes.
- [ ] Enable GitHub private vulnerability reporting and publish root
  `SECURITY.md` with `security@haddenindustries.com` as fallback, no-public-
  report guidance, the exact supported-version table, the five-working-day
  acknowledgement target as non-SLA, and advisory/CVE handling; verify external
  delivery and sole individually authenticated, MFA-protected access by Maksym
  Shostak.
- [ ] Publish Contributor Covenant 3.0-based root `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` with
  `conduct@haddenindustries.com`, Maksym Shostak as the sole initial HADDEN
  INDUSTRIES LTD-appointed moderator, restricted handling and non-adjudication
  when he is conflicted; verify external delivery, separation from the security
  channel and exclusion from the npm tarball. Do not make a second moderator a
  release gate.
- [ ] historical versions `1.0.0`, `1.1.0`, `1.2.0`, `1.2.1`, `1.3.0`,
  `2.0.0` and `2.0.1` are treated as permanently consumed and never reused.
- [ ] After production `0.1.0`, use available `0.1.x` patch coordinates,
  beginning with `0.1.1`, only for compatible corrections that are actually
  required. Expect the ontology-lifecycle capability programme at `0.2.0`, but
  advance it to the next available zero-minor if an intervening incompatible
  correction consumes that coordinate. Do not reserve any later zero-major or
  post-zero coordinate in advance.
- [ ] Before production `0.1.0`, refresh the §2.10.1 package-identity and
  immutable-coordinate evidence; retain the dated registry probes/results and
  block for a separate version decision only on an unexpected coordinate
  conflict. Defer the comprehensive exact/range consumer audit to a separately
  authorized post-zero stability-promotion programme.
- [ ] complete §22 source-provenance audit and machine-readable provenance manifest.
- [ ] every relevant legacy module/fragment has exactly one provenance disposition: `REUSE_ALLOWED`, `REFERENCE_ONLY`, `REIMPLEMENT`, `EXCLUDE`, or `REVIEW_EXCEPTION`.
- [ ] no new production module was mechanically translated from Java OWLAPI implementation source/comments/control flow.
- [ ] Java OWLAPI compatibility tooling is isolated to development/test infrastructure and absent from runtime/package bundles.
- [ ] public/normative implementation sources and project-owned differential fixtures are recorded for each semantic module.
- [x] select `AGPL-3.0-only` as the `owlapi` package licence after provenance
  separation, for deliberate network-aware source reciprocity rather than
  because of avoidable OWLAPI implementation derivation.
- [x] identify Maksym Shostak as the current personal copyright owner of his
  existing contributions and HADDEN INDUSTRIES LTD, registered in England and
  Wales under company number 07862561, separately as project steward; do not
  infer copyright title from the company, repository or npm identity.
- [x] record that assignment to HADDEN INDUSTRIES LTD is optional and is not an
  alpha, production-release or implementation-plan completion gate; keep any estate
  planning or private legal instrument outside Git/npm.
- [ ] make `package.json`, README, `NOTICE`, `LICENSE`, provenance and the exact
  retained tarball agree on the §2.13 author URL, personal copyright ownership,
  company-stewardship boilerplate and authoritative AGPLv3 link.
- [ ] complete a tarball-scoped rights inventory identifying each copyright
  holder or authorized licensor and the basis for distribution authority.
- [x] select `AGPL-3.0-only` inbound=outbound as the initial
  outside-contribution model, with no speculative CLA required before an
  external copyrightable contribution exists and a mandatory decision gate
  before the first such contribution is merged.
- [ ] obtain exact approval for and publish the root `CONTRIBUTING.md`; link it
  from the package README and make the policy-consistency governance test green.
- [ ] attest that every copyrightable item in the reviewed alpha scope has an
  identified holder and adequate distribution authority, with no unresolved
  external contribution.
- [ ] Generate and human-review the complete §2.50
  `docs/provenance/third-party-material.json` inventory for the production graph,
  release-relevant development material and copied/generated third-party files,
  with inspected licence/notice-file digests, SPDX expressions, relationships
  and distribution scopes; mechanically reconcile the tarball `NOTICE`, and
  separately reconcile WebVOWL's emitted bundle with its own deployment-scope
  inventory/notices.
- [ ] complete Public API Surface Registry and generated Java compatibility/gap view.
- [ ] dependency-governance/conformance manifest for foundational syntax parsers.
- [ ] Pin `@rdfjs/data-model@2.1.2`, `@rdfjs/dataset@2.0.3`,
  `@xmldom/xmldom@0.9.12`, `jsonld@9.0.0`, `n3@2.3.0` and
  `rdfxml-streaming-parser@3.3.0` in the initial manifest/lockfile by carrying
  forward the qualified 24 August 2026 WebVOWL staging baseline; isolate every
  later foundational runtime update in its own fully gated pull request.
- [ ] Enable Dependabot alerts, security updates and weekly proposal-only version
  updates with the §2.32 grouping; allow exactly the five §2.56 Action
  repositories, pin each recorded release to its exact full SHA with an adjacent
  tag comment, require full-SHA pins in repository settings, prohibit
  auto-merge, and do not run Renovate for the same responsibility.
- [ ] Create exactly `ci.yml`, `release.yml`, `maintenance.yml` and
  `extended-tests.yml` under `.github/workflows/` with the §§2.55–2.61 triggers,
  trust boundaries and Action/input contract. Each has root `permissions: {}`
  and job-minimal authority;
  none uses `pull_request_target`, privileged `workflow_run`, a cross-workflow
  release candidate or an external reusable workflow.
- [ ] Every checkout uses exact `actions/checkout@3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1`
  (`v7.0.1`) with `persist-credentials: false`; ordinary jobs use depth one,
  while only the release source/tag-verification job checks out the captured
  `github.sha` with full history and tags. The npm publication job performs no
  checkout.
- [ ] Every Node setup uses exact
  `actions/setup-node@820762786026740c76f36085b0efc47a31fe5020`
  (`v7.0.0`), a literal approved Node patch, `check-latest: false` and
  `package-manager-cache: false`, with neither `cache` nor
  `cache-dependency-path`; steady OIDC publication has no `registry-url`, scope,
  `always-auth` or `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`, and the temporary bootstrap credential is
  exposed only to its one publish step before that branch is removed.
- [ ] The exact §2.56 upload/download Actions move only the tarball, CycloneDX
  SBOM and `SHA256SUMS` under a version/run/attempt-specific candidate name.
  Upload records its ID/digest and uses the closed retention/compression/
  overwrite/hidden-file policy; download selects that immutable ID into a new
  fixed directory without merge, broad selectors or cross-run credentials, then
  rejects an unexpected inventory and independently verifies every checksum.
- [ ] Every required job uses and validates exactly `ubuntu-24.04` x64,
  `windows-2025` x64 or `macos-15` arm64 according to §2.57; no moving, preview,
  slim, larger, self-hosted or container runner appears. Ubuntu alone builds,
  packs, publishes and finalizes; Windows/macOS can qualify only the downloaded
  candidate.
- [ ] Run the complete package suite on Ubuntu under Node `22.23.2` and
  `24.19.0`; run the focused installed-tarball public-boundary/representative-
  load/import-purity/no-network suite on both patches under Windows and macOS;
  and make all six Node/host combinations blocking in CI and release.
- [ ] Select explicit `bash` for Ubuntu/macOS and `pwsh` for Windows, keep
  nontrivial workflow policy in cross-platform repository `.mjs` scripts, and
  emit the requested label, OS/architecture, ImageOS/ImageVersion, OS/kernel,
  Node/npm and applicable browser identity for every required job.
- [ ] `release.yml` uses the repository-wide `owlapi-release` concurrency group
  with `cancel-in-progress: false` and `queue: max`; CI cancels only superseded
  work for the same PR/ref, while maintenance and extended workflows use their
  distinct non-cancelling single-pending groups. Only the `npm-release`
  publication job has `contents: read` plus `id-token: write`; only the
  `release-manual` tag/publication-confirmation and evidence jobs add
  `actions: read` to `contents: read`; only separate GitHub-release mutation
  jobs have `contents: write`; and no job combines those authorities. The maintenance
  health check is read-only and its separate reporter has only `issues: write`.
- [ ] Expose exactly one GitHub-Actions-owned `CI / required` branch-protection
  aggregate plus separately required CodeQL, and one pre-publication
  `Release / qualified` aggregate on which the protected npm job directly
  depends. Governance checks keep each explicit `needs` inventory synchronized;
  `if: always()` is confined to the small aggregate evaluators; dependency
  review emits its closed push-only non-applicability reason; and every skipped,
  cancelled, timed-out, missing or otherwise non-success mandatory conclusion
  fails closed.
- [ ] Every required matrix uses `strategy.fail-fast: false` with no effective
  `continue-on-error`, swallowed status or neutralized report; every job/step
  has the exact §2.58 timeout; npm and project-owned HTTP reads use only the
  approved bounded retry settings; every external write receives one automatic
  attempt; and any ambiguous response is reconciled read-only against the exact
  remote identity/digest before either verification resumes or renewed explicit
  authorization is requested for a new write.
- [ ] Set fork workflow approval to `all_external_contributors`, keep Actions
  creation/approval of pull requests disabled, and prove every external-fork and
  Dependabot run uses only `pull_request` with root-denied/job-read-only
  permission, no secret/OIDC/environment/write authority and a new maintainer
  execution approval for each run; the approval is not represented as code
  review or continuing contributor trust.
- [ ] Governance proves the ephemeral fork candidate stays inside unprivileged
  jobs of the same CI run/attempt; no privileged event fetches or executes fork
  code/output; contributor/external values are validated as data rather than
  interpolated into shell or written raw to workflow-command files; credential
  jobs prohibit context dumps/tracing/debug authentication output; retained
  outputs are sanitized; and suspected exposure triggers immediate revoke/
  rotate/removal/inspection rather than reliance on masking.
- [ ] Configure the read-only weekly §2.48 `owlapi@latest` monitor to create or
  update one structured finding when a clean lockless consumer's smoke,
  production-audit or signature gate fails; grant it no npm-write or automatic
  source/dependency/tag/release mutation authority.
- [ ] Require a full `npm audit --json`, blocking
  `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` and exact
  `actions/dependency-review-action@a1d282b36b6f3519aa1f3fc636f609c47dddb294`
  (`v5.0.0`) on pull requests with `contents: read`, runtime scope, high severity,
  vulnerability checks on, licence checks/comments/Scorecard/patched-version
  display off, snapshot-warning retry on, 120-second timeout and
  `warn-only: false`;
  validate every false-positive/inapplicability exception against the §2.34
  fields and 30-day maximum, block reachable critical findings and never run an
  automatic audit fix on release inputs.
- [ ] The source manifest and lockfile contain the exact §2.54 development-tool
  versions, `devEngines.packageManager.version` is `12.0.2`, blocking workflows
  use Node `22.23.2`/`24.19.0`, every npm tool runs through a named local
  `npm run` script, and executable negatives reject remote `npx`,
  `npm exec --package`, global-development-tool and runner-preinstalled-tool
  release paths.
- [ ] Exact `vite@8.2.2` produces the package-fixture bundle-size report for
  mandatory and optional syntax adapters; the isolated WebVOWL consumer records
  and uses its own independently accepted Vite lockfile version without a
  synchronization update.
- [ ] `npm pack --dry-run --json` packlist and actual tarball contents agree;
  executable negatives exclude tests, corpora, JARs, oracle fixtures,
  benchmarks, WebVOWL/VOWLBuilder, credentials, duplicate/generated/minified
  code, source maps, TypeScript declarations and non-shipped repository docs.
- [ ] The actual retained tarball and the independent registry download both
  pass local exact `publint@0.3.24` in strict mode with identical relevant findings.
- [ ] The GitHub-hosted, manually dispatched `release.yml` run accepts only the
  captured protected-`main` head, derives version/tag/channel from reviewed
  files, proves the canonical tag is initially absent, and builds one retained
  tarball before that tag exists. At §§2.60–2.61's late boundary it waits without
  a runner at `Release / tag accepted`, then verifies the
  human-created SSH-signed annotated tag's already-authorized signer and exact
  captured-commit target through `docs/provenance/release-signers.json`, and uses
  separate clean full-tool and `npm ci --omit=dev` subject workspaces to generate
  a validated reproducible CycloneDX 1.6 JSON library SBOM with exact
  `@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm@6.0.1`. It independently reconciles
  the subject's unflattened/full-PURL graph with `npm ls`, the lockfile and packed
  inventory, generates the exact sorted two-entry §2.52 `SHA256SUMS`, passes the
  files unchanged only between jobs in that run through the exact §2.56
  upload/download SHAs and closed input maps, records the candidate artefact ID
  and archive digest, retrieves only that ID, rejects extra/missing files and
  verifies each transfer's SHA-256 without consuming a release cache,
  installs/audits them in clean consumers, smoke-tests all five public
  specifiers in Node, and fails if any release step changes the captured source
  tree. A rerun never republishes an existing coordinate and can resume
  verification only after proving the public bytes/attestation/tag match the
  retained subject.
- [ ] After npm fresh-cache verification, generate and schema-check
  `owlapi-<version>.release-evidence.json` with exact `ajv@8.20.0` plus
  `ajv-formats@3.0.1` against its versioned Draft 2020-12 schema, attach it before
  immutable release publication, then use checksum-verified GitHub CLI `2.98.0`
  under §2.52 in a fresh job to verify the
  immutable release and each of the four downloaded assets, strictly check the
  tarball/SBOM checksums and independently verify the signed tag/commit without
  adding a redundant detached evidence signature. Commit the append-only
  repository `release.json` with evidence digest, immutable release URL and all
  attestation/verification identities; do not treat expiring Actions logs/
  artifacts as the canonical record.
- [ ] the retained tarball passes exact `@playwright/test@1.62.1` in its matching
  Chromium, Firefox and WebKit revisions as three separate, one-worker,
  cache-free `ubuntu-24.04` jobs against exact `vite@8.2.2` package fixtures;
  install each engine/dependency set through the lockfile-owned CLI and a named
  npm script, never `npx`, an Action, runner browser or container; extended
  branded/historical/real-device
  evidence is reported only as `PASS`, `FAIL` or reasoned/date-stamped `NOT_RUN`,
  never terminal `INFRASTRUCTURE_ERROR`.
- [ ] Later extended-environment executions add dated files beneath
  `docs/provenance/releases/<version>/extended-tests/` and may regenerate a
  summary, but never overwrite an earlier observation or rebuild the package.
- [ ] The reviewed release pull request is squash-merged and manually dispatched
  at its accepted protected-`main` commit. Every deterministic gate and, for
  steady-state publication, stage download/byte equality/revalidation completes
  before the human creates the immutable release-specific SSH-signed annotated
  tag and approves `Release / tag accepted`; tag verification then precedes
  draft-release mutation. In steady state, interactive 2FA promotion completes
  before the second `Release / publication confirmed` approval and fresh-
  registry verification.
- [ ] `npm-release` always requires explicit human approval of the exact
  registry operation, permits only protected `main` and contains the bootstrap-
  only secret until removal. The separate `release-manual` environment permits
  only protected `main`, names `MaksymShostak` as required reviewer, has no wait
  timer/custom rule/secret/variable, and every job reference sets
  `deployment: false`. Both permit the initiating named custodian to approve and
  leave prevent-self-review disabled; independent deployment approval is not a
  Phase 19/20 gate unless separately approved later.
- [ ] The `maksymshostak` npm account's first direct write either succeeds as
  retained `owlapi@0.1.0-alpha.0` under `next`, uses the explicitly recorded
  §2.60 `0.1.0-alpha.1` successor after immutable prepublication abandonment, or
  produces preserved classified evidence for npm Support; no shared login or
  unrecorded fallback name/version is used.
- [ ] fresh-cache post-publication verification proves `next` resolution,
  registry integrity/content equality, exact root-package registry signature/
  provenance/publish-attestation/source-workflow/transparency identity under
  §2.51, absence of `latest`,
  working exact exports and rejected alternates, exact discovery/channel/
  `devEngines` metadata, import purity/tree shaking, the JSPM reference/local-
  mirror gate, locked/lockless graph reconciliation, strict registry-tarball
  lint, material/NOTICE agreement, CycloneDX/evidence validation, zero-telemetry
  local parsing and
  expected failure of an unqualified prerelease install; only then publish and
  verify the immutable GitHub release and every automatic tag/asset binding.
- [ ] Exercise the §2.33 bad-release procedure as a non-mutating rehearsal over
  fixture metadata: select/remove the affected channel, construct an exact-
  version deprecation record, preserve immutable evidence and reject routine
  unpublish or any unrelated historical fallback coordinate.
- [ ] Exercise §2.60's four failure boundaries with fixture state: correct and
  reuse an untouched version before tag creation; reconcile an unchanged-input
  ambiguous write without duplicating it; reject the stage, preserve the signed
  tag and emit the append-only failed-attempt record when a deterministic
  correction is required after tag creation; and advance an abandoned alpha to
  `0.1.0-alpha.1` or production to `0.1.1` without ever reusing/moving that tag.
- [ ] Exercise §2.61's manual hand-offs with workflow/API fixtures: bootstrap
  requires one `release-manual` approval after tag creation and before draft/npm
  authority; staged release requires that gate plus a second approval after 2FA
  promotion and before registry verification; rejection, premature approval,
  30-day expiry and re-run reconciliation fail closed without polling, duplicate
  mutation or bespoke tag/comment trailers. Retain and schema-validate the
  read-only workflow-review history and authorized reviewer identity.
- [ ] Test and record whether `@hadden-industries:owlapi-maintainers` can receive
  verified read-write access to the unscoped package with Maksym Shostak as its
  only required natural-person member; regardless of that result, npm
  custodianship remains solely `maksymshostak`, with no generic/shared account or
  claim that the team supplies human redundancy.
- [ ] Maksym Shostak's GitHub organization/repository authority, 2FA/package-access
  controls and subsequent GitHub Actions OIDC trusted publishing are configured
  for exact `Hadden-Industries/owlapi`, `.github/workflows/release.yml` and
  `npm-release` identities;
  automatic provenance is verified, the publisher is restricted to stage-only
  authority, traditional token publication is disabled, and the §2.53 staged
  candidate's pre-tag and pre-approval `stage view`, download/digest and
  interactive-2FA approval path is rehearsed without a public write. The
  rehearsal handles missing/non-pending stages without assuming a retention
  period or blindly restaging. Maksym Shostak rehearses and records the release/recovery
  runbook; the one-day, bypass-2FA bootstrap token's actual npm scope and single
  attempted use are recorded, that token and `npm-release` environment secret are
  revoked/removed immediately, a reviewed configuration change removes the dead
  bootstrap branch/reference, and no redundant `actions/attest` step exists.
- [ ] canonical source commit, `v0.1.0-alpha.0` Git tag, WebVOWL-origin commit
  map, tarball/SBOM checksums, registry integrity, normalized npm root
  attestation, immutable GitHub release/per-asset verification,
  `owlapi-0.1.0-alpha.0.release-evidence.json`,
  append-only repository release record, public URLs, tool versions, workflow
  path/blob/run/attempt, effective permissions/environment/concurrency,
  `release-manual` review history/gate ordering/no-polling result, same-run
  artefact IDs/digests, custodian and verification evidence are recorded before
  the Phase 19 checkpoint.

### Production `0.1.0` completion

- [ ] Stabilize only the accepted capability families through test-proven
  defect, security, portability, diagnostic, documentation, and packaging
  corrections; direct all new semantic feature families to
  `ontology-lifecycle-capability-implementation-plan.md`.
- [ ] Refresh the package-identity and immutable-coordinate evidence no more
  than seven days before production publication and resolve any unexpected
  coordinate conflict; do not impose the deferred post-zero range audit here.
- [ ] Publish and verify at least one exact `0.1.0-rc.N` retained tarball through
  all package, four required Windows/macOS portability, three required Ubuntu
  Chromium/Firefox/WebKit, immutable-release and isolated public-registry
  WebVOWL gates in one serialized manually dispatched late-tag `release.yml` run,
  using a dedicated release pull request and
  `publishConfig.tag=next` plus explicit `npm stage publish ... --tag next`;
  record the stage ID, inspect/download the candidate, prove its SHA-256 equals
  the retained tarball, rerun its required checks, create the signed tag, approve
  `Release / tag accepted`, verify/populate the draft, and only then approve the
  stage with interactive 2FA followed by `Release / publication confirmed`,
  without creating or moving `latest`.
- [ ] Freeze observable behaviour after the accepted release candidate, account
  for every production-tarball difference, and publish only the separately
  authorized retained `owlapi@0.1.0` artefact through the same §§2.55–2.61
  workflow/Action/runner boundary after changing and validating
  `publishConfig.tag=latest` plus explicit `npm stage publish ... --tag latest`;
  bind the stage ID, downloaded candidate's matching SHA-256, source tag/commit,
  fixed tag, both ordered `release-manual` review records and interactive-2FA
  approval before verification/finalization.
- [ ] Mark every accepted public binding `INITIAL_DEVELOPMENT`, every retained deprecated
  binding `DEPRECATED_INITIAL_DEVELOPMENT` and every private engine `INTERNAL_ONLY`; reconcile
  those rows with `API.md`, compatibility data and executable exports.
- [ ] Enforce §2.27 zero-major SemVer/deprecation rules: compatible corrections
  use available `0.1.x` patches beginning with `0.1.1`; material additions or
  incompatible protected-surface changes use the next available zero-minor;
  the lifecycle programme normally uses `0.2.0`; and a deprecated binding
  remains operational throughout its current 0.minor patch line without
  unsolicited console output.
- [ ] Verify from a fresh cache that `latest` resolves exactly to the production
  cutover version—normally `0.1.0`—all five public entry points work,
  internal/deep/metadata/alias paths fail, discovery/channel metadata and the
  exact npm `12.0.2` `devEngines` value agree, import purity/tree shaking and the
  exact `@jspm/generator@2.16.3`
  reference/public-URL/local-mirror suite pass, locked/lockless graphs reconcile,
  strict registry-tarball lint passes, package/WebVOWL material inventories and
  notices agree with their distribution scopes, the exact npm root attestation
  validates, the separate-workspace `@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm@6.0.1` graph and
  Draft 2020-12 `ajv@8.20.0`/`ajv-formats@3.0.1` evidence validate, the exact
  Playwright/Vite, Ubuntu Node/npm and Windows/macOS installed-tarball matrices
  pass with their exact runner-image records,
  local parsing is zero-telemetry/no-network, CodeQL/secret state is accepted,
  and registry integrity/content match the retained evidence.
- [ ] After production verification, separately authorize removal of the stale
  `next` pointer; verify that `latest` remains the production cutover version,
  `next` is absent, no unapproved tag exists and bare `npm install owlapi`
  selects the production cutover. Recreate `next` only for a genuine future prerelease.
- [ ] Update WebVOWL to exact public-registry `owlapi@0.1.0`, or only after a
  recorded §2.60 or §2.33 activation the exact applicable same-surface patch, regenerate its
  registry-backed lockfile, and pass its boundary, Jest, development/production
  build, corpus, RDF/XML, imports-aware workload and deployment-scope third-
  party-material/notice gates.
- [ ] If `0.1.0` fails a mandatory check after publication, preserve it,
  remove `latest`, deprecate it when safe, run the full release-candidate/production process for
  the first corrective patch and record why that patch became the cutover;
  never unpublish or silently substitute a version as ordinary rollback.
- [ ] If deterministic correction becomes necessary only after immutable
  `v0.1.0` exists but before npm publication, reject the stage, leave the tag
  untouched, retain the §2.60 failed-attempt record, and run the same frozen
  surface through the complete `0.1.1` release-candidate/production gate; record that this—not a
  post-publication rollback—made `0.1.1` the first production release and WebVOWL cutover.
- [ ] Record the production source commit, signed tag, tarball digest, registry
  integrity, validated reproducible CycloneDX 1.6 SBOM, `SHA256SUMS`, npm
  root-package attestation, stage ID/view/download/status/timestamp metadata at
  both required boundaries, retained-versus-staged
  digest proof, `release-manual` review history/two-gate ordering and approving
  identities/times, immutable GitHub release and
  per-asset/checksum/tag verification, `owlapi-<version>.release-evidence.json`,
  append-only Draft
  2020-12-validated
  repository release/extended-test/registry-operation records, required/
  extended browser matrix, every §2.54 local/external tool version and digest,
  every §2.55 workflow/job-permission/environment/concurrency identity, every
  §2.56 Action tag/SHA/input/cache/credential/artefact/dependency-review result,
  every §2.57 requested/observed runner, OS/architecture, image, shell,
  portability and browser-host result, every §2.58 aggregate inventory/result,
  mandatory-job conclusion/applicability/timeout, matrix failure policy,
  concurrency queue, controlled-read retry and external-mutation/reconciliation
  result, every §2.59 fork-run approval/trust origin/effective-authority,
  same-run quarantine, validated input/output, sanitized logging/debug and
  exposure-response result, every §2.60 late-tag/abandonment result, every §2.61
  no-authority environment/no-runner-polling/manual-gate result, custodian,
  WebVOWL consumer commit, security
  support-window update and final verification evidence before declaring this
  plan complete.

### Event-triggered contributor-governance checkpoint

This checkpoint is dormant while no external copyrightable contribution is
proposed for merge and is not an unfinished Phase 19 or production-release task. At
the first such merge boundary:

- [ ] identify the actual rights holder and submission authority before
  incorporation;
- [ ] separately approve either continued pure `AGPL-3.0-only`
  inbound=outbound or the exact contributor-retained CLA described in §2.14.1;
- [ ] obtain any additional agreement before merge, never by retroactive
  presumption; and
- [ ] preserve the decision and contribution-specific evidence without
  committing private signatures or personal information.

## 31. Research Findings Behind the Final Decisions

### 31.1 W3C structural model is intentionally API-suitable

The OWL 2 Structural Specification describes the conceptual structure independently of concrete exchange syntax and explicitly allows tool APIs/internal models to follow that structural specification so long as observable behaviour conforms. This is direct standards support for using it as `owlapi-js`'s semantic IR.

### 31.2 Structural equivalence is stricter than “same meaning” and different from JS identity

OWL structural equivalence is syntactic structural equality, not logical equivalence. Most associations are unordered duplicate-free sets; explicitly ordered associations are list-like. Axiom annotations affect structural equivalence. This is why a structural key/equality layer is required rather than ordinary JavaScript object identity.

### 31.3 OWLAPI parsers produce ontology objects, not quads

The OWLAPI `OWLParser` contract says parsers add axioms to the supplied `OWLOntology`. That supports direct structural parsing for OWL/XML, Functional and Manchester rather than routing them through RDF.

### 31.4 OWLAPI has explicit mappings in both directions

- `AbstractTranslator` / `RDFTranslator`: ontology → RDF graph.
- `OWLRDFConsumer`: RDF graph → OWL entities, expressions and axioms using triple handlers.

This independently validates the proposed separation between structural ontology and RDF representation.

### 31.5 RDF/JS deliberately uses quads as the universal RDF statement shape

The current RDF/JS Data Model requires RDF terms/quads to be treated as immutable and specifies that triples are represented as quads with `DefaultGraph`. This makes RDF/JS the natural interoperability boundary for a modern JavaScript implementation.

### 31.6 RDF datasets contain more structure than RDF graphs

Current RDF Concepts defines a dataset as one default graph plus zero or more named graphs. Graph names are dataset structure, not automatically provenance. This supports preserving the quad graph term and prohibiting silent dataset flattening.

### 31.7 Direct format-specific RDF parsers are a stronger core dependency strategy than `rdf-parse`

`rdf-parse` is technically capable and usefully demonstrates that multiple RDF syntaxes can converge on RDF/JS quads. However, it is itself a dispatch/orchestration layer, while `owlapi-js` already needs OWLAPI-compatible parser selection. Making it foundational would duplicate responsibilities and increase transitive dependency authority.

The stronger core design is direct format adapters:

- RDFJS-hosted **N3.js** for Turtle/TriG/N-Triples/N-Quads, with broader N3-language ingestion `DEFERRED`;
- RDFJS-hosted **`rdfxml-streaming-parser`** for RDF/XML, backed by a published W3C RDF/XML report showing 162/162 tests passing;
- Digital Bazaar **`jsonld.js`** for JSON-LD, with its official JSON-LD test-suite integration and configurable document loader.

All converge immediately on RDF/JS. Parser choice is therefore replaceable without altering RDF→OWL or consumer code.

### 31.8 Dependency governance is part of semantic architecture

A standards library can be technically correct yet still be a poor foundational dependency if its release authority, succession path, transitive supply chain or browser cost are unsuitable. Conversely, a small project can be a defensible parser dependency when it has strong conformance evidence and is isolated behind a standard replaceable boundary.

The project therefore **MUST** maintain explicit dependency-governance records and pinned exhaustive conformance manifests under §18.13. The architectural objective is **verified replaceability**, not permanent trust in any one package.

Comunica, rdflib and Oxigraph remain credible alternatives for different deployment profiles, but are intentionally not core defaults: Comunica duplicates orchestration through its bus/actor architecture, rdflib is a much broader Linked Data toolkit, and Oxigraph's Rust/WASM approach has attractive supply-chain/conformance properties but a materially heavier browser footprint.

### 31.9 W3C conformance tests explicitly favour structural equivalence over one serialization

OWL 2 syntax-translation tests accept differing serializations when they describe structurally equivalent ontologies. This supports moving golden tests away from RDF/XML strings toward structural snapshots and graph equivalence.

### 31.10 Java OWLAPI remains a strong behavioural oracle, not a production implementation template

OWLAPI's long history and continuing parser/round-trip fixes demonstrate that edge cases are real. Its public API surface, accepted/rejected inputs and resulting structural ontologies are valuable compatibility evidence; its architectural separation also informs this blueprint at a conceptual level. The replacement JavaScript implementation should nevertheless be independently authored from public specifications and project-owned behavioural tests rather than mechanically translating Java implementation code. This preserves both JavaScript-native architecture and future licence-choice independence.

### 31.11 The JavaScript ecosystem gap is historically explainable

The 2014 `owljs` project explicitly used JVM calls to OWLAPI from JavaScript rather than reimplementing the stack. Combined with the later success of RDF/JS, this explains why JavaScript gained excellent RDF infrastructure without a comparably mature structural OWLAPI.

### 31.12 Licence choice is decoupled from implementation provenance

The project selected the reciprocal `AGPL-3.0-only` licence as a governance
choice separate from how the implementation was authored. A
specifications-first independent implementation with permissively compatible
production dependencies preserved that choice rather than forcing it.
Historical OWLAPI-derived code therefore belongs in the migration/provenance
audit and characterization harness, not automatically in the new production
core. The resulting independence matters just as much for confidently applying
strong copyleft as it would have mattered for choosing a permissive licence.

### 31.13 Sequential ingestion migration is the selected delivery contract

The project contains a finite, known parser/adapter programme and deliberately prioritizes cumulative learning transfer over parser-team concurrency. The selected delivery contract is therefore one WIP-locked ontology-ingestion migration at a time across the complete v1 sequence, including RDF→OWL hardening. Rolling-wave learning may refine/reorder future phases through governance, but there is no evidence threshold that automatically enables parallel parser migrations.

### 31.14 Software-engineering experience must be packaged for reuse, not merely archived

The Experience Factory tradition in software engineering and modern lessons-learned practice both support a deliberate cycle in which project experience is collected, generalized, packaged and applied to subsequent work. NASA's current lessons-learned model similarly emphasizes **Collect → Record → Disseminate → Apply**.

For this migration, the practical consequence is a two-layer knowledge design: detailed per-implementation lesson records preserve evidence, while a continuously curated parser-migration playbook captures the current best method. Important lessons should additionally become executable tests/contracts/fitness checks so future teams inherit them automatically.

### 31.15 Rolling-wave elaboration refines future implementation details without changing the WIP lock

The architecture, semantic invariants, release scope and acceptance criteria should be stable enough to coordinate the programme. Detailed implementation steps for later parser migrations should remain progressively elaborated because earlier migrations are expected to change the best known method. After each learning gate, update the next phase in detail and permit evidence-based reordering of later phases without reopening non-negotiable architectural decisions.

### 31.16 OWL-native and RDF syntaxes are separate semantic architectures but one cumulative sequential implementation-learning programme

The code must maintain the strict semantic boundary—OWL-native parsers construct structural OWL; RDF parsers construct RDF/JS datasets and rely on `RdfToOwlTranslator`. The delivery process should nevertheless carry cross-cutting lessons across that boundary. N3-family, RDF/XML and JSON-LD adapter work should inherit prior knowledge about parser selection, diagnostics, source/document IRIs, resource safety, environment differences, differential testing and provenance while adding RDF-specific lessons of their own.

### 31.17 `owlapi` is the clearest npm identity despite immutable unrelated history

The npm context already identifies JavaScript, and npm's package-name guidance
specifically recommends against adding `js` or `node` for that reason. The
short unscoped name `owlapi` is therefore more semantically direct than
`owlapi-js` for consumers, while “Java OWLAPI” remains sufficient to distinguish
the reference implementation in prose.

The unrelated former `owlapi` releases create a permanent exact-coordinate cost
but not a live-artifact collision. Real npm 12.0.2 installation probes against
the public registry found no installable version, exact historical coordinate,
range or `latest` tag. npm's immutable-registry policy means only the seven known
`name@version` coordinates are permanently unavailable; it does not document a
requirement that a reclaimed package begin above the former highest version.
That makes `0.1.0-alpha.0` a valid candidate for the registry's normal write path
to accept or reject.

Starting at `3.0.0` would also isolate the new implementation from ordinary
dormant `^1` and `^2` dependencies, but it would make a new implementation
appear to possess two earlier maintained generations. It would not protect
against `*` or every sufficiently broad lower-bounded range. The chosen sequence
instead uses SemVer's conventional initial-development space:
`0.1.0-alpha.0` under `next`, followed by production-recommended `0.1.0` under
`latest`. Ordinary former 1.x and 2.x ranges cannot select that 0.x line. No
post-zero coordinate is selected now; a future stability-promotion programme
must audit the then-current immutable history and range evidence before choosing
between available options such as `1.0.1` or the more isolated `3.0.0`.

Section 2.60 does not revise that version choice in advance. It supplies only
the explicit successor rule if an already-observable immutable release tag must
be preserved after a deterministic prepublication failure.

That is a deliberate namespace-discontinuity exception, not a claim that the new
`0.1.0` patches or preserves the old `1.0.0`. Transparent README, changelog and
release-note disclosure is stronger than pretending the historical identity
never existed. Prepublication evidence therefore verifies the package identity,
known immutable coordinates and actual 0.x availability; it does not claim that
an unbounded search can prove no private consumer exists. The comprehensive
historical range audit belongs at the future post-zero decision, when former
ranges could materially affect the coordinate choice.

An actual reviewed prerelease is the correct availability test because success
is a desired release. A placeholder is not: it burns a public coordinate,
provides no function and conflicts with npm's active-use policy. `--dry-run`
validates the artefact but not write authority, and staged publication cannot
bootstrap a new package because npm requires the package and write permission
to exist already. If the direct authenticated write is rejected for namespace
control, its exact error becomes the evidence for npm Support; it is not a
licence to silently choose another name.

### 31.18 A first-party consumer should not have a privileged import path

An application that reaches directly into a sibling source tree proves only
that those files exist in the repository. It does not prove that the package
declares the entry point, that Node/Vite can resolve it, or that the intended
encapsulation is usable. A bundler alias has the same defect: it can conceal a
broken or missing `exports` entry.

Making WebVOWL declare and import the exact registry `owlapi` package turns the
principal real-world consumer into a continuous external contract test. Bare
specifier resolution exercises the named public surface; registry integrity and
the installed tarball additionally prove the artefact and dependency closure
that outside consumers receive. A retained-tarball WebVOWL trial provides the
prepublication gate without committing a local development route.

### 31.19 A useful first alpha and production consumer readiness are separate gates

The accepted Phase 18 core already performs substantial standards-grounded work
and is useful to WebVOWL and other ingestion consumers. Requiring every known
future workflow before publishing it would turn package release engineering
into an unbounded semantic phase and delay the namespace claim without making
the added APIs more rigorous.

The stronger sequence is to publish that proven surface honestly as
`0.1.0-alpha.0`, with precise limitations, exercise it through the public
registry and WebVOWL, correct demonstrated production failures, and freeze that
surface through a `0.1.0` release candidate before production publication. This
avoids both extremes: a content-free reservation package and an indefinitely
unpublished package blocked by workflows its first production consumer does not
need. The mutually dependent closure-query, mutation, merger and storage
capabilities remain one coherent later feature programme; they do not define
whether the accepted ingestion package is production-ready.

### 31.20 Start with network-aware strong copyleft; preserve later options explicitly

The first public `owlapi` release uses `AGPL-3.0-only`. Its network-interaction
source provision expresses the project's reason for performing a
specifications-first reimplementation rather than merely repackaging legacy
derived code: downstream freedom and reciprocal access are part of the product
contract, including when modified software is operated for users across a
network.

Starting with strong copyleft preserves the possibility that authorized
copyright holders may later offer their work under additional or more
permissive terms, whereas rights already granted in a permissive release cannot
be retroactively narrowed for its recipients. That future option is not
automatic, however. Outside contributions can divide relicensing authority, so
the selected initial policy is explicit `AGPL-3.0-only` inbound=outbound before
any external copyrightable contribution exists. A speculative CLA is
unnecessary for the first alpha, but the project cannot merge its first such
contribution on autopilot. At that boundary it must either preserve adequate
project authority through a contributor-retained CLA or knowingly accept that
later relicensing will require contributor-by-contributor consent. Deferring the
decision until that contributor exists avoids unused administration; deferring
it until after merge gives the project no right to assume a broader grant.

### 31.21 Personal copyright, succession and operational custody are distinct

An npm account, organization slug or copyright notice can identify an operator
without transferring copyright. The project therefore separates legal title,
durable recipient permissions and registry/repository custody. Maksym Shostak
currently owns his existing project-owned contributions personally; HADDEN
INDUSTRIES LTD is the project steward rather than their copyright owner or
licensor.

UK copyright law treats a computer program as a literary work, ordinarily
protects human-authored literary work for 70 years from the end of the calendar
year in which the author dies, and permits copyright to pass by assignment,
testamentary disposition or operation of law. The official GNU AGPLv3 text also
makes compliant grants irrevocable for the copyright term and automatically
licenses downstream recipients. The author's death therefore neither retracts
already published AGPL rights nor prevents continued compliant maintenance.

The approved release path does not require a lifetime assignment. A will or
later written assignment may direct ownership to HADDEN INDUSTRIES LTD or
another chosen successor, but that private estate/legal decision is not a
software-release gate. If an assignment later takes effect, notices and
attestations are updated prospectively without erasing authorship or outside
contributors' ownership.

Personal ownership does not by itself make the project operationally survivable.
Independent natural-person account redundancy would address availability more
directly than copyright assignment, but it is deliberately outside this
implementation plan. Through `0.1.0`, Maksym Shostak remains the sole human
custodian; GitHub organization authority, MFA, trusted publishing, recovery
material and a tested runbook bound compromise and operator error without being
misrepresented as bus-factor elimination. Copyright succession remains a
separate legal control.

### 31.22 Java OWLAPI's contributor model is informative but not equivalent

At the 23 August 2026 review point, Java OWLAPI's current `version5` repository
published its incorporated work under both LGPLv3 and Apache-2.0 but exposed no
repository- or OWLCS-organization-level CLA, DCO, copyright assignment or
contributor-rights guide. GitHub's repository-licence terms therefore supply an
inbound=outbound baseline for GitHub submissions, while Apache-2.0 §5 expressly
places an intentionally submitted contribution under Apache-2.0 unless the
submitter states otherwise. Contributors retain their copyright; the project
and downstream recipients receive the applicable licence and patent grants.

That is not a precedent for assuming that an AGPL-only project can later make
outside code permissive. Java OWLAPI includes the permissive Apache-2.0 option
in its inbound and outbound terms from the outset. By contrast, an outside
`owlapi` contribution accepted solely under `AGPL-3.0-only` supplies no general
permission to publish that contribution later as MIT or Apache-2.0. The project
would need an additional grant from the actual holder or would need to exclude
and independently replace the affected expression. This distinction supports
the §2.14 first-external-merge checkpoint without requiring CLA administration
before any such contributor exists.

### 31.23 Independent filtered history is stronger provenance than a fork badge

A GitHub fork records an ongoing repository-network relationship; it does not
identify the source checkpoint, admitted paths, excluded changes or byte-level
equivalence of an extracted module. Here it would also make a separately
governed library appear to remain a variant of the WebVOWL application and
would carry unrelated application history into the new project's public
context.

The stronger evidence is a reproducible history-preserving filter from a fixed
public WebVOWL commit, coupled with complete commit partitioning, an original-
to-rewritten commit map and before/after hash manifests. This retains relevant
authorship/evolution while letting the package repository own only its actual
product boundary. Keeping the original mixed branch unchanged until the
rewritten package and UI/UX histories verify makes the transformation auditable
without leaving two maintained source trees.

### 31.24 The origin story is the unmet combination, not raw parser availability

The initiating landscape discussion found useful adjacent projects but no
evaluated implementation that combined an ordinary JavaScript Node/browser
package, a broad structural OWL model, required syntax/RDF mapping behaviour and
the asserted ontology access needed by OWL2VOWL without retaining the JVM or
adopting a materially different model/reasoner surface. That combination—not a
claim that every alternative was deficient—justified building the library.

This finding is valuable public context because it explains the architectural
choices: OWL structures rather than raw triples alone, RDF/JS as an interop
boundary, Java OWLAPI as behavioural oracle, WebVOWL as first demanding consumer
and VOWL concepts excluded from the package. The README should carry that
reasoning alongside an honest alpha capability statement so readers understand
both why the package was built and what it currently promises.

### 31.25 Java-recognizable entry points are stronger than exposing RDF implementation seams

Node's explicit subpath exports provide a closed, evolvable public interface,
but the subpath names still need to express domain responsibilities. Java
OWLAPI developers ordinarily meet `OWLManager` through `apibinding`, structural
objects and the manager through `model`, document sources through `io`, and
format identities through `formats`. Mapping those concepts to explicit npm
subpaths makes primary workflows recognizable without mechanically copying the
entire Java package tree.

RDF reconstruction and translation are different. Java OWLAPI contains RDF
consumer/translator implementation packages, but ordinary loading and storage
are manager/document/format operations. The JavaScript implementation follows
that user-facing architecture: RDF/JS datasets remain the correct internal
interoperability boundary, while manager-mediated calls remain the public OWL
API. This preserves all current WebVOWL ingestion behaviour, reduces the public
surface, and leaves room for a later use-case-driven RDF/JS document-source or
target adaptation without pre-committing an `owlapi/rdf` namespace.

### 31.26 Cross-language API fidelity does not require a mirrored private tree

The Java language maps package names naturally to directory paths, but its
specification also makes clear that similarly prefixed packages do not gain a
special access relationship merely from that hierarchy. Node's package
`exports` mechanism independently maps public consumer specifiers to physical
modules and encapsulates every unlisted subpath. Cross-language library guidance
likewise combines a uniform external model with language-idiomatic private
implementation.

The strongest arrangement for this project is therefore neither wholesale Java
transliteration nor an unrelated JavaScript facade. Public binding ownership
follows each deliberately exposed Java package at its complete path, making the
API recognizable and the Java-to-JavaScript mapping auditable. The private
parser, mapping, loading, storage and platform engines follow their cohesive
JavaScript responsibilities. A public compatibility type may delegate to one of
those engines, but it is not duplicated in a mirrored `internal/` namespace.

The Public API Surface Registry provides the missing traceability: it joins the
pinned Java package/type inventory, behavioral capability matrix, npm specifier,
JS export, canonical source module, compatibility classification, progress and
verification evidence. This supports honest subset claims, exposes gaps to
prospective contributors and prevents either the source tree or an accidental
barrel export from becoming the API authority.

### 31.27 A no-transform ESM library should publish one readable production tree

npm's positive `files` allowlist controls which repository files become the
installed artefact, while Node's explicit `exports` map defines which installed
modules are public. Neither mechanism requires a `dist/` directory. When package
source is already supported native ESM and undergoes no compatibility transform,
copying it into a generated distribution tree adds a second representation and
trust boundary without changing what consumers execute.

For `owlapi`, publishing the tagged readable source directly therefore improves
packed-file auditability, debugging, deterministic comparison and AGPL source
identification. The same reasoning removes source maps: there is no minified or
transformed generated program that needs mapping back to a different authored
program. Explicit release commands remain preferable to automatic lifecycle
hooks because the retained-tarball workflow must make each gate and mutation
visible.

### 31.28 Version-matched API and compatibility documents belong with this package

npm renders the root README from the published version, while the `files`
allowlist can deliberately include additional consumer documentation. Most
repository history and policy does not belong in an installed library, but this
project's API and Java compatibility registries are part of its central claim:
they distinguish implemented Java-compatible public bindings, private engines,
deferred capabilities and known deviations.

Shipping the bounded README/API/changelog/licence/notice/compatibility set makes
those claims inspectable for the exact installed bytes and avoids silently
redirecting a user to documentation for a later default branch. Generating or
mechanically checking the human API view against the machine registries and
installed exports preserves one authority while still providing usable prose.
It does not justify a separate documentation website before a consumer need
exists.

### 31.29 Type declarations would require a separate API-design decision, not a metadata toggle

TypeScript can emit declarations from JavaScript, but its documented workflow
requires TypeScript tooling, compiler configuration, type-bearing JSDoc and a
published declaration layout. `owlapi`'s large structural surface has not been
designed or verified under that contract. A partial declaration would therefore
create a second, inaccurate public API precisely when `0.1.0` is freezing the
runtime one.

The rigorous current choice is to publish honest native JavaScript with no
official declarations and to state that boundary. This plan does not schedule a
declarations project. If demonstrated demand later justifies the separately
authorized, non-implementing exploration in §2.26, that exploration may assess
whether any approach could cover all five public roots, mirror their export
paths, verify representative consumers and remain synchronized with the Public
API Surface Registry. It produces options and a recommendation only; any actual
implementation would need a new architecture decision, configuration approval,
implementation plan and version decision.

### 31.30 Disciplined zero-major SemVer needs an explicit observable-contract boundary

Node's `exports` encapsulation supplies a strong module boundary but does not by
itself say which methods, structural fields, errors or ordering properties are
protected. Conversely, JavaScript lets consumers observe many private accidents
that should not become guarantees. The surface registry and API reference must
therefore distinguish protected public behaviour from unexported paths,
dependency choices and incidental representation details.

This classification makes the unusual available-version sequence manageable.
Compatible corrections use available `0.1.x` patches beginning with `0.1.1`.
Material additions or incompatible protected-surface changes advance to the
next available `0.minor.0`; the ontology-lifecycle programme normally occupies
`0.2.0`, but advances if that coordinate is consumed first. Documentary
deprecation without unsolicited runtime logging gives consumers a migration
path throughout the current zero-minor patch line. Later zero-major and
post-zero coordinates remain unallocated until an approved release programme
needs them.

### 31.31 Bounded automation narrows custody authority but does not create human redundancy

npm's documented model is clearest for a user publishing an unscoped public
package and for organization teams controlling organization-scoped packages.
That distinction makes it unsafe to infer that an organization team can own or
administer this reclaimed unscoped coordinate merely because the GitHub
repository lives in an organization. The first publication therefore uses the
known natural-person npm identity, then tests the unscoped package's real access
controls and records the result.

An organization team, when supported, may provide an accurate registry-level
relationship but does not eliminate the bus factor when its only required human
member is the same person. The selected implementation-plan model therefore
records the team experiment while retaining Maksym Shostak as sole human
custodian and combines that explicit limitation with an exact-repository,
exact-workflow OIDC trusted publisher whose stage-only authority and interactive
approval are narrower than a reusable publication token. A shared generic
account would weaken attribution without adding genuine human redundancy and is
therefore prohibited. A future additional natural-person custodian requires a
separate post-plan governance decision.

### 31.32 A dormant `next` tag is misleading mutable state, not useful history

npm distribution tags are named mutable pointers used by ordinary install
resolution; immutable versions and retained release artefacts already preserve
history. `next` is useful while it deliberately selects a live prerelease and
`latest` is withheld. After production verification, leaving `next` on an older RC
suggests an actively recommended alternate channel, while pointing both tags at
the production release adds no information. Removing `next` until the next real prerelease keeps
the registry's channel semantics honest without deleting any version.

### 31.33 A protected trunk should match the project's actual reviewer capacity

GitHub rulesets can protect branches and tags, require checks and reviews, apply
to administrators and expose auditable bypasses. The strongest initial policy is
not the most ceremonial one: requiring a nonexistent independent reviewer would
either deadlock the repository or normalize bypass. One protected `main`, short-
lived pull requests, squash merges and immutable release tags protect real
history now. If a second active code maintainer later makes independent review
truthful, activating it still requires a separately approved post-plan
configuration change; it does not happen inside this plan merely because an
account appears.

Signed annotated release tags plus workflow provenance identify release source
without imposing a signed-commit burden on every contributor. Long-lived
`develop`, release and maintenance branches similarly add merge surfaces before
concurrent release lines create a need for them.

### 31.34 Release automation should validate accepted intent, not invent it

A version number, compatibility statement, controlled deviation and release
note are product decisions. Encoding them in a dedicated reviewed release pull
request makes the complete proposed release visible before the immutable tag and
registry write. `npm version --no-git-tag-version` remains a useful mechanical
synchronization tool, but its output is an input to review rather than authority
to commit or publish.

The release workflow consequently has one simpler trust role: reproduce and
validate the accepted commit, build one artefact and transport it through
approval to registries. If the workflow edits tracked state, makes its own
commit/tag or synthesizes authoritative notes, the reviewed source and published
release can diverge. Human-curated changelog and release text avoid that hidden
second author while release volume is low.

### 31.35 Semantic runtime dependencies deserve exact, independently reviewed updates

The six direct runtime packages parse XML/RDF syntaxes, construct RDF terms and
datasets, or implement JSON-LD algorithms. A nominally compatible update can
therefore change ontology acceptance, reconstruction, diagnostics, resource use
or browser closure without an `owlapi` source edit. Exact public pins make that
semantic input reviewable and reproducible; the lockfile alone governs the
maintainer install but would still let downstream consumers resolve a different
version from a ranged public manifest.

Dependabot is useful here as discovery and proposal automation, not as release
authority. Isolating foundational runtime updates preserves causal evidence;
grouping compatible development tooling reduces noise; full-SHA Action pins
bound workflow code; and human-reviewed, fully gated updates prevent automation
from silently redefining parser behaviour. A merged security update protects no
existing registry consumer until the fixed graph is shipped in a new package
version.

### 31.36 Deprecation and channel containment are safer than routine unpublish

npm deliberately makes published coordinates immutable and recommends
deprecation when removal would break dependents. That makes a bad release two
different facts: its bytes/history must remain auditable, while mutable guidance
and default-install routing may need immediate correction. An exact-version
deprecation plus a recorded `latest`/`next` rollback or removal contains new use
without pretending the release never existed.

Initial `0.1.0` has no legitimate earlier Hadden Industries production fallback.
The unrelated former `1.0.0` cannot become one merely because its coordinate is
numerically convenient. A deterministic failure after immutable `v0.1.0` but
before npm publication is the distinct §2.60 abandonment case: `0.1.0` remains
absent rather than being routed or deprecated. If the first production release fails only after publication,
temporarily removing `latest` and publishing the fully gated `0.1.1` correction
is less misleading than either routing users to unrelated history or declaring
a failed artefact production-ready. Extraordinary confidentiality, malware and
legal cases remain removal incidents because their safety objective can override
ordinary reproducibility.

### 31.37 Audit severity is a gate input, not an automatic remediation policy

`npm audit` can report the full dependency graph and separately fail at a chosen
severity threshold; GitHub dependency review focuses on what a pull request
introduces. Using both prevents a PR-only check from overlooking existing risk
and prevents a release-only scan from accepting a newly introduced issue without
review context.

Severity alone cannot prove reachability or non-applicability, but ontology
parsers routinely process untrusted input, so high/critical production findings
cannot be downgraded casually. A bounded machine-readable exception makes a
genuine false positive reviewable without becoming a permanent invisible
allowlist. Automatic audit fixes are unsuitable because they mutate the exact
semantic dependency graph outside the approved one-update-per-PR evidence path.

### 31.38 Manual authorization and independent authorization are separate controls

GitHub environments independently support a required reviewer and an optional
prevent-self-review rule. Requiring an explicit click after the artefact digest
and registry operation are known prevents unattended publication even when the
initiator supplies that click. It does not provide separation of duties, and the
plan does not describe it as doing so.

For the present maintainer model, that deliberate one-person gate avoids making
release availability depend on a second person's schedule while preserving the
entire technical and evidentiary pipeline. It does not solve account/recovery
continuity, and this plan explicitly accepts that limitation. If post-plan
governance later appoints another genuine custodian or the threat model justifies
independent approval, prevent-self-review can be enabled through an explicit
policy/configuration change rather than inferred from mere account membership.

### 31.39 Existing verified SSH signing is the smallest coherent release-tag trust root

GitHub verifies signed tags made with SSH, GPG or S/MIME. The current WebVOWL
history already contains GitHub-verified SSH signatures, so using SSH for
release tags avoids introducing a second personal key toolchain merely for
ceremony. OIDC provenance still proves which workflow published the package;
the SSH tag separately proves which authorized human fixed the release source.

A versioned signer registry and pre-release key-admission rule solve the
continuity problem that “verified” alone does not: they say which verified keys
the project authorized, for whom and during what interval. Retaining historical
keys and revocation dates preserves old verification while letting prospective
authority rotate. Keeping private keys outside CI prevents the workflow from
manufacturing the human authorization it is supposed to verify.

### 31.40 Structured intake should reduce ambiguity without pretending to be a support desk

Issue forms can require the package version, syntax, reproduction and
specification/Java compatibility identity that a parser report needs. Providing
an “other” form retains an escape hatch, so blank issues add little except
missing context. A pull-request template can similarly surface provenance,
SemVer, registry and test implications without turning checkboxes into a
contributor licence agreement.

GitHub Issues are sufficient while community volume is unknown. A generic
support mailbox or Discussions instance would create another moderation and
response surface before demand exists; security and conduct already have
purpose-specific private channels. `CODEOWNERS` becomes valuable when ownership
or review routing is real, not when it points every path back to the sole current
reviewer.

### 31.41 Publish-channel metadata is useful only when every authority agrees

npm applies `publishConfig` at publication time and both direct and staged
publication accept an explicit command-line tag. A staged package's tag cannot
be changed during approval. A prerelease-safe `tag: next` therefore becomes a
production-release defect if it survives unchanged into `0.1.0`; omitting the field
entirely loses a useful guard against accidentally assigning a prerelease to
`latest`. The stronger design makes the reviewed per-version manifest and
explicit registry operation redundant assertions and fails closed when they
disagree.

Deriving the expected channel mechanically from SemVer avoids a second policy
table hidden in workflow conditionals. Post-publication verification is still
necessary because neither a correct manifest nor a correct command proves the
mutable registry pointer ended in the authorized state.

### 31.42 Discovery metadata should describe capability, not aspiration or project ancestry

npm uses `description` and `keywords` for search/discovery. Precise OWL 2,
ontology, RDF/JS and supported-syntax terms help an intended consumer find the
package without claiming a reasoner, general knowledge-graph platform or
WebVOWL-specific API. The qualified Java-compatibility wording is consistent
with the bounded Public API Surface Registry rather than implying complete Java
source/binary parity.

Optional package fields are not badges. `funding` should lead to a real funding
destination, `contributors` should represent actual curated contributor
metadata, and npm access state—not an invented manifest field—governs
maintainers. Omitting semantically empty fields is more accurate than filling
them with company/repository URLs already represented elsewhere.

### 31.43 Workflow retention and release retention solve different problems

Public-repository Actions logs and artifacts expire after at most the configured
90-day period, so a workflow URL alone cannot support a durable release claim.
Immutable GitHub release assets and their automatic attestation protect the
fixed publication snapshot; a compact repository record can then add the
post-release URL/attestation identity and later append new non-blocking evidence
without changing the package.

Separating immutable publication-time evidence from append-only later
observations preserves both truths: what was known when the version shipped and
what was learned afterward. It also avoids retaining sensitive or enormous raw
logs merely to keep a few reproducible commands, versions, digests and results.

### 31.44 Default CodeQL and push protection add useful security without a second workflow product

GitHub's CodeQL default setup supports JavaScript without a special build and is
the lowest-maintenance starting point. Requiring its high/critical result on the
protected trunk prevents a public hostile-input parser from merging an obvious
new source vulnerability, while dependency review remains necessary for its
different dependency-diff responsibility. A separate advanced CodeQL workflow
or lower-precision extended suite has no demonstrated value before default
coverage is evaluated.

Secret scanning detects existing exposures; push protection can stop supported
credentials before they enter the public history. A bypass record cannot make a
real credential safe, so actual exposure always requires rotation/revocation
and incident handling. Distinct, expiring source-analysis exceptions preserve
reviewability without pretending a CodeQL rule and a GHSA dependency advisory
are the same evidence type.

### 31.45 Zero telemetry must include transitive behaviour and user-directed network clarity

Ontologies may contain confidential terms, identifiers, internal IRIs or
unpublished research. A library that silently uploads errors or checks a remote
service would violate the trust boundary even if it did not upload the complete
document. Testing the installed dependency closure matters because a transitive
package can introduce the same request without a direct `fetch` in `owlapi`.

Caller-enabled import/context loading is different: it retrieves a document the
caller expressly asked the manager to resolve under bounded security policy.
Naming that distinction allows the package to promise zero telemetry without
falsely promising that every deliberately network-enabled ontology load remains
offline.

### 31.46 One explicit `exports` map is a stronger compatibility boundary than redundant entry fields

Node recommends `exports` for new packages targeting supported runtimes because
it defines multiple entry points while encapsulating every unlisted subpath.
`main` is primarily an older-tool fallback and becomes subordinate when both
exist. `module` and `browser` are ecosystem conventions with different
resolution semantics, while conditional branches would contradict the proven
portable-source design.

The five Java-recognizable specifiers are already the approved contract. One
literal map therefore gives tools and humans the same finite inventory, makes a
new public path an intentional SemVer event and prevents metadata/deep-file
reach-in from becoming accidental API. Adding redundant aliases would expand
Hyrum-law exposure without serving a supported consumer.

### 31.47 `sideEffects: false` is safe only when import purity is an enforced architecture property

Bundlers may discard an entire module/subtree when package metadata says it has
no side effects. That is valuable for a parser package with many optional/lazy
format paths, but a false assertion can remove registration, polyfill or setup
code only in optimized builds. Development imports alone would not expose that
failure.

`owlapi` already prohibits ambient parser registration, global mutation,
telemetry and import-time I/O. Making the whole package-owned closure pure and
testing both instrumented import and optimized used/unused consumers is thus
more coherent than omitting the field defensively. If source requires an import
side effect, the architecture—not the metadata—has regressed.

### 31.48 `devEngines` separates repository tooling from consumer runtime promises

npm distinguishes `engines`, which communicates package runtime compatibility
to installers, from `devEngines`, which validates the environment operating the
source repository before npm install/CI/run commands. Putting the release npm
patch in `engines.npm` would warn consumers even though their npm version does
not execute `owlapi` at runtime.

An exact npm-native `devEngines.packageManager` value makes lockfile and release
tool identity reviewable without adding Corepack or a second top-level
`packageManager` authority. Keeping the development runtime name as `node` but
leaving its version to the existing engine/CI matrix also permits the deliberate
non-blocking Node Current probe without silently expanding support.

### 31.49 A JSPM reference provider can prove native import maps without becoming package infrastructure

`@jspm/generator` can link local entry modules, trace static and literal dynamic
imports, resolve an exact browser/production/module graph through a named
provider and emit integrity metadata. That matches the application-owned map
contract more directly than a hand-maintained map or a new package export.

The provider still represents an external delivery system. Hydrating and
integrity-checking its exact graph, then running an untransformed local mirror,
separates semantic/browser evidence from transient CDN availability while a
separate URL check keeps the published reference honest. Keeping provider URLs
out of production source lets another application self-host the same graph and
keeps `jspm.io` replaceable.

### 31.50 SBOM reproducibility and evidence validity require explicit, independently checked tools

The CycloneDX npm generator can produce JSON 1.6, identify the root as a
library, omit development dependencies, validate its output and remove
time/random values for reproducibility. Generating from the installed production
tree is stronger than lockfile-only inference, but its result is still checked
against npm's own installed graph, the lockfile and packed inventory so one tool
does not become the sole dependency authority.

Release/governance evidence has a different problem: structural drift. JSON
Schema Draft 2020-12 plus a pinned Ajv validator can reject missing, mistyped or
silently invented fields before a record is trusted. Stable `$id`/schema
versions and closed records make changes explicit. Publication observations are
necessarily event-specific rather than reproducible, so preserving and
attesting their accepted bytes is more honest than adding a redundant detached
signature or claiming two release events should serialize identically.

### 31.51 A library lockfile proves its release graph, not every future consumer graph

`package-lock.json` makes the canonical source/CI installation reviewable and
repeatable, but npm cannot publish that lockfile as dependency-resolution
authority and ignores one below the consumer root. npm can instead publish an
`npm-shrinkwrap.json` and apply its dependency tree from the point encountered,
but expressly does not recommend that mechanism unless publication is producing
a deployed CLI or another production package. A shrinkwrap or bundled payload
does not fit a reusable, browser-deduplicated semantic API whose parser engines
remain separately resolved packages.

Exact direct dependency versions therefore protect `owlapi`'s selected semantic
engines without pretending to freeze their entire future transitive closure.
Testing both the locked release graph and a new lockless consumer graph makes
that distinction observable. A read-only fresh-resolution monitor detects later
registry drift without turning an immutable version into a mutable deployment.

### 31.52 Independent tarball lint catches packaging assumptions that custom tests can share

Project governance tests are strongest for project-specific policy, but they can
repeat the same mistaken model as the manifest they validate. `publint` checks
actual package/tarball metadata and files against Node and common bundler
resolution conventions, including missing published targets, invalid ESM format,
local dependency leakage and repository/export problems.

Passing the retained `.tgz` directly avoids a second pack and makes the input
identical to the release artefact. Exact pinning and strict warning handling make
the result reviewable, while suggestions remain advice and a narrow expiring
exception prevents a generic tool from silently overruling a deliberate,
better-tested package contract.

The 24 August 2026 registry check found `0.3.24` to be the current `publint`
release. Recording it as the present baseline makes the plan executable without
turning `0.3.24`-or-greater into a floating install. A later exact release remains
eligible, but only after its changed rules and output have been reviewed as a
tooling update.

### 31.53 Licence evidence follows the bytes in each distribution

An SPDX expression provides precise standardized vocabulary, but a package
manifest string alone does not prove which licence/notice files or embedded
third-party fragments are actually present. Conversely, ordinary npm
dependencies are not copied into the `owlapi` tarball merely because the
manifest causes a consumer to install their separate tarballs.

A component/file relationship inventory therefore distinguishes external
dependencies from copied, embedded or generated material and keeps the package
`NOTICE` aligned with the bytes it accompanies. WebVOWL's bundler can later
embed those external modules into an application distribution, so that emitted
bundle receives its own inventory/notice review rather than inheriting an
inapplicable package-level conclusion.

### 31.54 npm provenance must be validated at the exact root coordinate

npm provenance supplies provenance and publish attestations, backed by Sigstore
verification material and public transparency evidence. The
`npm audit signatures --json --include-attestations` command exposes the data
needed to verify installed packages, but an aggregate count cannot establish
that the required attestation belongs to `owlapi@<version>` or names the intended
repository/workflow.

The release validator must therefore select the root coordinate and compare its
registry integrity, subject digest, source/workflow/tag/commit identity and
transparency evidence. This proves origin rather than benevolence or semantic
correctness; the independent source, test, audit and consumer gates remain
necessary.

### 31.55 GitHub release immutability becomes evidence only when every asset is verified

GitHub's immutable release attestation binds the tag, commit and attached
assets, and the GitHub CLI exposes separate release and local-asset verification
commands. The UI badge alone does not prove that a locally downloaded file is
one of those assets or that every member of the release set was checked.

The two pre-registry artefacts can share a conventional sorted checksum file;
the post-registry evidence record cannot be added to that already reviewed file
without mutation. Per-asset immutable-release verification covers all four
downloads, while the repository record preserves the evidence JSON digest and
verification identities. Independent SSH-tag verification keeps the human
source authorization distinct from GitHub's release attestation.

### 31.56 npm staged approval is trustworthy only when the reviewed candidate is the retained artefact

npm staged publishing deliberately separates an automated candidate upload from
an interactive proof-of-presence approval. The stage ID, fixed distribution tag,
`stage view` metadata and downloadable candidate provide a stronger review seam
than approving only a workflow run or a local filename. Hashing that download
against the retained release tarball closes the otherwise unproven gap between
the bytes that passed package gates and the bytes npm will promote.

That path cannot create a previously unpublished package: a package and write
permission must already exist before `npm stage publish` can succeed. The useful
alpha therefore remains the one direct bootstrap write. A one-day granular
access token with non-interactive bypass-2FA is an acknowledged bootstrap
exception, not the steady-state design; its real effective scope is recorded,
it permits one approved attempt, and immediate revocation is required. Once the
coordinate exists, exact-repository/workflow/environment OIDC, stage-only
authority, disabled token publishing, automatic provenance, digest equality for
the downloaded candidate and interactive 2FA approval provide the bounded
normal release path.

### 31.57 Release evidence needs a visible exact toolchain and an uncontaminated subject

A committed lockfile fixes the transitive development graph used by `npm ci`,
but the direct tools that interpret SemVer, construct browser fixtures, select
browser revisions, generate an SBOM, validate evidence or verify an immutable
release are themselves evidence authorities. Exact direct versions make those
authorities reviewable in the manifest and release record; named local npm
scripts prevent a remote `npx` fetch or host-global executable from silently
selecting another implementation.

The SBOM generator illustrates why version pinning alone is insufficient. It is
a development dependency and therefore cannot truthfully be present in the
production-only installation it describes. A full tool workspace and a separate
`npm ci --omit=dev` subject workspace let the exact generator inspect the real
subject without contaminating it. Independent npm/lockfile/pack reconciliation
then catches a generator classification or traversal omission instead of making
the tool's output self-authenticating.

Ajv deliberately leaves standard URI/date-time format implementations to the
separate `ajv-formats` package, so both must be fixed and registered if the
evidence schema is intended to validate more than string shape. Playwright
likewise couples its package to managed browser revisions, while Vite controls
the standalone bundler/worker fixture graph. The actual WebVOWL lockfile remains
an independent consumer authority rather than being synchronized for cosmetic
version equality.

GitHub CLI and `git-filter-repo` sit outside npm's lockfile. Fixing their release
versions and downloaded-file digests prevents a runner image or workstation PATH
from becoming undeclared release/provenance authority. A later security or
compatibility correction remains possible through an explicit exact replacement
and full affected-output review; reproducibility requires controlled change, not
permanent use of an obsolete tool.

### 31.58 Workflow topology is part of the release subject, not incidental CI plumbing

GitHub Actions code runs inside a token and artefact trust boundary. A broad
workflow-level permission silently grants that authority to every Action and
project command in every job, while a privileged follow-on workflow can turn an
untrusted checkout, cache or uploaded file into a repository or registry write.
Starting at `permissions: {}` and granting one job only its required capability
therefore reduces both accidental authority and the blast radius of a
compromised dependency.

A manual dispatch accepted only when its captured SHA equals the then-current
protected-`main` head supplies the objective pre-tag source commit; the version,
channel and expected tag are derived from reviewed repository state rather than
mutable dispatch text. The later protected signed tag independently anchors the
already-qualified public release at that same commit. Keeping build,
qualification, late-tag verification, publication and final verification in one
serialized `release.yml` run avoids the weaker pattern in which a privileged
workflow accepts an artefact built under another trigger. Independent hashes
still protect every same-run transfer. Disabling release cancellation matters
because a staged candidate, tag, npm version or draft release may already exist
even when the runner has not reached its final success state.

npm trusted publishing binds authority to the repository, workflow path and
environment. Reusing `release.yml` for the unavoidable direct bootstrap and the
steady OIDC path keeps that identity understandable; deleting the token secret
and then removing the dead bootstrap branch makes the continuing workflow
strictly less privileged without obscuring the bootstrap in history. A separate
GitHub-release job with `contents: write` cannot publish to npm, and the npm job
with `id-token: write` cannot mutate repository contents.

GitHub identifies a full commit SHA as the immutable Action reference. Enforcing
that policy in repository settings and restricting the allowed Action
repositories makes a forgotten floating `uses:` line fail closed. The workflow
references remain the sole execution authority; deriving their exact SHAs and
permissions into release evidence avoids creating a second manually synchronized
Action lock.

### 31.59 Full-SHA pinning is necessary; exact inputs complete the Action trust decision

The five selected GitHub-maintained Actions have deliberately useful defaults,
but a release workflow cannot treat those defaults as timeless security policy.
Checkout normally persists its authentication token for later Git commands;
release-source jobs also need different history/tag depth from ordinary test
jobs. Setup-node can infer npm dependency caching from package metadata even
when no explicit `cache` input appears, and its registry inputs create npm
authentication configuration. Those behaviors are reasonable for general CI
and wrong for this cache-free, OIDC-separated release chain unless explicitly
disabled or confined to the one temporary bootstrap step.

Artefact Actions likewise protect an archive transfer, not the semantic identity
of the release candidate on their own. Upload must close the file inventory and
record the returned artefact ID/digest; download must select that immutable ID
within the same run, refuse merge/overwrite broadening, and be followed by
independent file-count and SHA-256 verification. Dependency review is valuable
at the pull-request boundary only when it remains read-only and narrowly blocks
new high/critical runtime vulnerabilities; package licensing remains the exact
human-reviewed §2.50 inventory rather than an unrelated Action policy.

The smallest coherent inventory is therefore the five roles in §2.56. Repository
scripts, npm provenance, checksum-verified GitHub CLI and immutable-release
attestation already own publication, SBOM, checksum, provenance and release
verification. Adding cache, script, publishing, attestation or release-wrapper
Actions would duplicate those authorities and enlarge the reviewed supply chain
without deepening the release guarantee. A later Action update must consequently
review tag-to-SHA identity and every relevant default/input/output/runtime/
permission behavior together.

### 31.60 Versioned runner labels stabilize the OS family, not the hosted image

GitHub's `*-latest` labels identify the newest generally available image family,
not a permanent operating-system version. Explicit `ubuntu-24.04`,
`windows-2025` and `macos-15` labels remove that avoidable family migration, but
the images behind them still receive regular software updates. GitHub exposes
the actual runner-image identity in job setup metadata precisely because a label
does not freeze the VM. Honest release evidence must therefore record the image
that ran each gate instead of presenting the label as content-addressed
infrastructure.

That mutable substrate is acceptable for a readable-source JavaScript package
when artefact authority is narrow: exact Node/npm/tool versions create the
tarball on one Ubuntu family, the tarball itself is retained and hashed, and
other hosts test those same bytes rather than rebuilding. Windows x64 catches
the dominant alternate path/shell/encoding semantics; macOS arm64 adds both a
second OS and architecture. Running both declared Node patches on each converts
the manifest's broad Node promise into a small but meaningful blocking matrix
without repeating the full standards corpus six times.

GitHub's explicit `bash` mode has stricter error/pipeline behavior than its
unspecified non-Windows default, while PowerShell Core supplies the native modern
Windows command host and UTF-8 behavior. Keeping substantive checks in `.mjs`
files makes those shells thin orchestration layers rather than parallel policy
implementations. This is more maintainable and more genuinely portable than
forcing Git Bash everywhere or writing complex equivalent YAML scripts twice.

Playwright supports Ubuntu 24.04 and installs version-matched Chromium, Firefox
and WebKit plus their Linux dependencies. Its CI guidance prioritizes one worker
for stability; Linux WebKit is an appropriate engine-level check, while macOS is
mainly necessary when the subject depends on Safari-adjacent platform facilities
such as media codecs. This package tests module loading and ontology processing,
so three separate one-worker Ubuntu jobs deepen the browser contract without
adding a Docker image or converting branded Safari/device testing into a release
gate.

### 31.61 Aggregate checks and mutation-aware retry make automation failure explicit

GitHub required checks are name-based contracts, while matrix-generated names
and conditional jobs are implementation details that can drift. A small stable
aggregate is therefore safer than protecting every lane directly—but only when
its `needs` inventory is mechanically synchronized and it treats every skipped,
cancelled, timed-out, missing or failed prerequisite as failure. GitHub's
`always()` is appropriate for that evaluator because it must inspect failed
dependencies; applying it indiscriminately to substantive jobs would instead
encourage work to continue after a prerequisite failure. Dependency review is
event-specific, so the job must report a closed, checked push-only
non-applicability reason rather than vanish as an unexplained skip.

Matrix `fail-fast` optimizes feedback by cancelling sibling work, but release
evidence needs the complete host/browser picture. Disabling it on required
matrices does not weaken the gate: each lane still fails honestly and the
aggregate requires every conclusion to be `success`. Exact job and step
timeouts similarly convert hangs into finite failures rather than subjective
operator decisions.

GitHub concurrency has two separate questions: whether to cancel a running job
and how many pending runs to preserve. Release work answers “no” and uses the
documented `queue: max` bound of 100, because a run with external state must not
be cancelled and an older pending release attempt must not be silently replaced.
GitHub processes that queue according to when runs start waiting—not dispatch
time—and does not guarantee ordering, so each fixed-identity run must revalidate
remote state and never depend on a predecessor. Observational maintenance/
extended schedules can safely retain only the newest pending run. CI may cancel
only a superseded execution of the same change.

Retries are safe only when operation semantics are known. npm's bounded fetch
configuration and a project-owned `GET`/`HEAD` helper can repeat idempotent
reads after transient transport/408/429/5xx failures. Publication, approval,
tag, release, asset, issue and Git-ref mutations cannot be blindly repeated:
an interrupted response may hide a successful remote write. The safe recovery
is read-only reconciliation of the exact remote identity and digest, followed
by verification if already complete or renewed authorization for a genuinely
new mutation.

### 31.62 Fork approval controls compute; isolation and data-flow rules control trust

GitHub intentionally executes public-fork `pull_request` code with a read-only
token and without repository secrets, while allowing maintainers to require a
manual approval before spending compute. Requiring all external contributors is
stronger than first-contribution-only trust: GitHub warns that an innocuous
merged change can otherwise exempt a later malicious run. Because approval is
per workflow run, a new externally triggered revision returns to the execution
gate. That click does not make the proposed tree trustworthy; the no-secret,
no-write, ephemeral-run boundary remains necessary after approval.

`pull_request_target` reverses the default trust context and is safe only while
it does not fetch and execute the fork. Running the fork's script, dependency or
artefact from that or another privileged event creates the same pwn-request
shape regardless of which checkout/download command obtained it. This package
needs no privileged PR automation, so ordinary `pull_request` is both simpler
and safer. The same-run diagnostic candidate still permits real portability
testing without creating a promotion path to release.

GitHub expressions are substituted into generated shell source before
execution. Titles, refs and other flexible context fields can therefore become
commands when interpolated directly. Passing them through an environment
variable—or preferably a validating Node data boundary—keeps them values.
Workflow command files deserve the same treatment because an arbitrary newline
or delimiter can forge an output, environment variable or summary. Closed,
double-validated control values and ordinary data files make the boundary
reviewable.

GitHub masks registered and recognized secrets, but transformations and
job-local visibility make masking incomplete by design. Avoiding context dumps,
tracing and command-line credentials is the primary control; explicit masking
is additional containment. Once exposure is plausible, rotation/revocation is
the corrective action—editing evidence or trusting a displayed mask cannot
invalidate a credential that may already have escaped.

### 31.63 A canonical release tag should record a qualified decision, not be consumed to discover whether the candidate qualifies

A tag-push workflow is simple, but it must publish the permanent source label
before exercising release-only paths. That ordering is harmless only when the
project is willing to move/delete a failed tag or advance the package version
after every deterministic release-automation defect. Neither assumption fits an
immutable signed-tag policy plus the deliberately selected `0.1.0` terminal
coordinate.

GitHub's `workflow_dispatch` fixes a branch/tag ref and commit for a manual run,
while environment deployment restrictions evaluate that run's `GITHUB_REF`.
Dispatching only the captured protected-`main` head therefore supplies a stable
pre-tag source identity; the environment must honestly allow protected `main`
rather than a tag that did not trigger the run. npm trusted publishing binds the
repository, workflow filename and optional environment and explicitly supports
manual workflows. npm provenance exposes the exact source commit and workflow,
so source traceability does not depend on using a tag-push event.

Staged publishing gives the steady-state path a stronger reversible seam. The
non-public candidate can be viewed, downloaded, byte-compared and rejected before
the canonical Git tag exists; rejection permits a corrected candidate to reuse
the still-unpublished version only while no immutable source tag has consumed
that identity. The later human-signed tag still anchors the public release and
must exist and verify before staged promotion. The bootstrap package cannot use
that seam, so it delays the tag until every non-mutating qualification succeeds.

This ordering cannot make the interval after tag creation mathematically
failure-free. Its correct response is therefore explicit: reconcile transient or
ambiguous unchanged-input operations, but if a corrected commit is required,
preserve the observed signed tag, abandon the version and advance through the
full gate. That rare visible version gap is less misleading than either moving a
supply-chain identity or publishing bytes known not to be the qualified release.

### 31.64 A protected no-authority environment is the native same-run human hand-off

GitHub environment protection is job admission, not merely secret delivery. A
job that references an environment with required reviewers remains waiting and
is not sent to a runner until a reviewer approves it; an unapproved job
automatically fails after 30 days. Current GitHub Actions also permits
`deployment: false`: required reviewers and wait rules still apply, but the
coordination job does not create a misleading deployment object. This is a
cleaner release pause than spending runner minutes on a tag/registry polling
loop or introducing a cross-workflow continuation token.

The workflow-run approvals endpoint exposes the authenticated review history to
read-authorized code. Capturing that response alongside the fixed run/attempt,
gate jobs, stage/digest and signed-tag timeline supplies durable evidence of who
continued the run without granting the checkpoint npm, OIDC, Git-ref or GitHub-
release write authority. Reusing one `release-manual` environment for two
sequential jobs keeps configuration small; each job still receives its own
required review because every environment-referencing job is independently
admitted.

npm staged publishing already assigns public mutation to a different human
proof-of-presence step: the maintainer inspects the stage and later approves it
with 2FA. The GitHub gate should therefore acknowledge that completed work and
start read-only verification, not duplicate or automate the npm write. The
same-run artefact/stage/tag/evidence graph provides the substantive binding;
requiring ceremonial digest trailers in the immutable tag message would add a
new typo-driven failure mode without strengthening the verified identifiers.

### 31.65 A pending npm stage is remote mutable state, not a retained release asset

npm documents stage creation, listing, inspection, download, approval and
rejection, including the stage's shared version index and immutable requested
distribution tag. It does not currently promise a minimum pending-stage
retention period on which this project can base a release invariant. Silence is
not an infinite-retention guarantee, and GitHub's separate 30-day environment
expiry says nothing about npm's registry state.

The retained tarball and its digest are therefore the durable candidate; the npm
stage is a repeatedly reconciled remote binding. A fresh `stage view` immediately
before the irreversible Git-tag boundary and another immediately before 2FA
promotion prove that the same pending stage still exists. Missing or changed
state fails closed into the existing pre-tag reuse or post-tag abandonment
contract. This gives the workflow deterministic behavior if npm later documents
or changes stage retention without inventing a project guarantee today.

    https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se26/html/jls-7.html#jls-7.1

55. **OpenTelemetry cross-language client and package-layout guidance** — a
    cross-language API should remain uniform and clearly separated from its
    implementation while internal components follow language-idiomatic
    organization.<br>
    https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/library-guidelines/<br>
    https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/library-layout/

56. **Google Cloud client-library guidance** — cross-language libraries combine
    a consistent developer model with idiomatic code in each target language.<br>
    https://docs.cloud.google.com/apis/docs/client-libraries-explained

57. **GitHub immutable releases and release-integrity verification** — attach
    every asset while the release is a draft; publication locks the release tag
    and assets and creates an automatic release attestation.<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/concepts/supply-chain-security/immutable-releases<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-your-supply-chain/secure-your-dependencies/verify-release-integrity

58. **RFC 2142 and RFC 9116** — `SECURITY@domain` is the conventional security
    role mailbox; `security.txt` builds on that address convention for
    vulnerability-disclosure contacts.<br>
    https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc2142/<br>
    https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9116.html

59. **GitHub private vulnerability reporting** — repository owners can enable a
    private advisory channel; private reporting and `SECURITY.md` are distinct,
    complementary mechanisms.<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/how-tos/report-and-fix-vulnerabilities/report-privately<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/how-tos/report-and-fix-vulnerabilities/configure-vulnerability-reporting/configure-for-a-repository

60. **Contributor Covenant 3.0** — version-pinned Code of Conduct basis and
    adoption attribution for the canonical repository.<br>
    https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/3/0/<br>
    https://www.contributor-covenant.org/adopt/

61. **Node.js release schedule and package documentation** — Current/LTS status,
    maintenance dates, native ESM package semantics and the distinction between
    public `exports` and private conditional `imports`.<br>
    https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases<br>
    https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html

62. **Browserslist Baseline queries** — moving `baseline widely available` and
    date-frozen `baseline widely available on YYYY-MM-DD` query semantics used
    to distinguish alpha evolution from the production 0.1.x feature ceiling.<br>
    https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#baseline<br>
    https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features/

63. **WHATWG HTML Standard — import maps** — document-owned mapping of bare and
    URL-like static/dynamic module specifiers, scopes, merging and integrity
    metadata.<br>
    https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#import-maps

64. **MDN import-map reference and JavaScript modules guide** — current browser
    availability, inline document integration and the explicit absence of
    import-map application to workers/worklets.<br>
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/script/type/importmap<br>
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#importing_modules_using_import_maps

65. **JSPM Generator and provider documentation** — generated import maps,
    static/literal-dynamic graph linking, exact provider resolutions, integrity
    metadata and ESM conversion for CommonJS npm packages.<br>
    https://jspm.org/docs/generator/<br>
    https://jspm.org/getting-started

66. **npm package-file and README documentation** — positive tarball `files`
    selection, ordered package-file negations, automatic README/licence
    inclusion and the version-owned root README rendered on the npm package
    page.<br>
    https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/configuring-npm/package-json/#files<br>
    https://docs.npmjs.com/about-package-readme-files/<br>
    https://github.com/npm/npm-packlist#interpretation-of-the-files-list

67. **TypeScript declaration generation and publication guidance** — generating
    declarations from JavaScript requires TypeScript tooling, compiler
    configuration and type-bearing JSDoc; bundled declarations then form a
    separately published package/type-resolution surface.<br>
    https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/dts-from-js.html<br>
    https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/publishing.html

68. **npm unscoped-package, scope and organization guidance** — user publication
    of unscoped public packages, the distinction between scoped/unscoped package
    visibility, and organization membership/team administration.<br>
    https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-unscoped-public-packages/<br>
    https://docs.npmjs.com/package-scope-access-level-and-visibility/<br>
    https://docs.npmjs.com/about-organization-scopes-and-packages/<br>
    https://docs.npmjs.com/adding-members-to-your-organization/

69. **GitHub repository and tag rulesets** — available branch/tag protections,
    pull-request requirements, bypass controls and organization/repository
    ruleset configuration.<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/available-rules-for-rulesets<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/creating-rulesets-for-a-repository

70. **npm version command** — exact version selection, manifest/lockfile
    synchronization and `--no-git-tag-version` behaviour used only as a reviewed
    release-preparation aid.<br>
    https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-version/

71. **GitHub Dependabot version/security updates** — proposal configuration,
    update grouping and security-update operation for repository dependencies.<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/concepts/supply-chain-security/dependabot-version-updates<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/concepts/supply-chain-security/dependabot-security-updates<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file

72. **GitHub Actions secure-use, permission and repository-policy guidance** —
    full commit SHAs are the immutable Action reference; workflow/job permissions
    should be explicit and least-privilege; repository policy can require full
    SHAs and restrict the permitted Action set.<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/security/secure-use<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax#permissions<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository

72a. **GitHub workflow-trigger, concurrency and cache-trust guidance** —
     privileged `workflow_run`/`pull_request_target` contexts must not execute
     untrusted content; concurrency can serialize deployments; caches are not
     signed evidence and require trust-boundary care.<br>
     https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows<br>
     https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/deploy/configure-and-manage-deployments/control-deployments<br>
     https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/dependency-caching

72b. **Exact selected GitHub Action releases** — official release records for
     the five tag-to-full-SHA mappings frozen on 24 August 2026.<br>
     https://github.com/actions/checkout/releases/tag/v7.0.1<br>
     https://github.com/actions/setup-node/releases/tag/v7.0.0<br>

     https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action/releases/tag/v5.0.0

72c. **Selected Action input and output contracts** — authoritative definitions
     for checkout credential/history behavior, setup-node cache/registry
     behavior, closed artefact upload/download and dependency-review policy.<br>
     https://github.com/actions/checkout/blob/v7.0.1/README.md<br>
     https://github.com/actions/setup-node/blob/v7.0.0/README.md<br>

     https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action/blob/v5.0.0/README.md

72d. **GitHub-hosted runner labels and mutable image identity** — explicit GA
     OS-family/architecture labels, fresh hosted VMs, image-version visibility
     and the regular preinstalled-software update process.<br>
     https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/runners/github-hosted-runners<br>
     https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/runners/github-hosted-runners<br>
     https://github.com/actions/runner-images

72e. **GitHub shell and Playwright host guidance** — explicit shell invocation
     semantics, Ubuntu 24.04 support, version-matched browser installation,
     one-worker CI guidance and Linux WebKit's role.<br>
     https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax#jobsjob_iddefaultsrunshell<br>
     https://playwright.dev/docs/intro<br>
     https://playwright.dev/docs/ci<br>
     https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers

72f. **GitHub required-check, dependency, matrix and timeout semantics** —
     required checks must report a successful conclusion; prerequisite results
     can be inspected by an `always()` aggregate; matrix fail-fast is
     configurable; and jobs/steps support explicit deadlines.<br>
     https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/how-tos/merge-and-close-pull-requests/troubleshooting-required-status-checks<br>
     https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/use-jobs#defining-prerequisite-jobs<br>

     https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax#jobsjob_idtimeout-minutes

72g. **GitHub concurrency/cancellation and npm read/staged-operation
     controls** — workflow groups independently define running cancellation and
     pending-queue behavior; npm exposes bounded fetch retry/timeouts; staged
     publication separates candidate creation, inspection/download and
     approval.<br>
     https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-when-workflows-run/control-workflow-concurrency<br>
     https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-cancellation<br>
     https://docs.npmjs.com/using-npm/config/<br>
     https://docs.npmjs.com/staged-publishing/

72h. **GitHub public-fork execution, script-injection and secret-log guidance**
     — public repositories can require every external contributor's workflow
     run to receive maintainer approval; ordinary fork `pull_request` runs are
     read-only and secretless; privileged execution of fetched fork code is
     unsafe; untrusted contexts belong in data variables rather than generated
     shell; and automatic masking is not guaranteed.<br>
     https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository<br>

     https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/security/secure-use<br>
     https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/security/secrets

72i. **GitHub manual-dispatch/environment identity and npm late-tag publication
     guidance** — a manually dispatched workflow runs at its selected branch or
     tag ref/commit; environment branch/tag restrictions match `GITHUB_REF`; npm
     trusted publishers bind repository/workflow/environment and support manual
     workflows; provenance exposes source commit/workflow; and a staged package
     can be inspected, downloaded and rejected before interactive promotion.<br>
     https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch<br>
     https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/deployments-and-environments#deployment-branches-and-tags<br>

     https://docs.npmjs.com/staged-publishing/<br>
     https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-stage/

72j. **GitHub no-deployment environment gates and workflow-review evidence** —
     every job referencing a required-reviewer environment waits before runner
     allocation; `deployment: false` retains reviewer/wait protection without a
     deployment object; an unapproved job fails after 30 days; and the read-only
     workflow-run approvals endpoint exposes authenticated review history.<br>
     https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-when-workflows-run/trigger-a-workflow#using-environments-to-manually-trigger-workflow-jobs<br>

     https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflow-runs#get-the-review-history-for-a-workflow-run

73. **npm deprecation and unpublish guidance** — exact-version warning messages
    preserve installability, while unpublish is irreversible, can break
    dependents and never frees the consumed coordinate.<br>
    https://docs.npmjs.com/deprecating-and-undeprecating-packages-or-package-versions/<br>
    https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/unpublish/

74. **npm audit and GitHub dependency-review guidance** — full JSON reporting,
    severity-based failure thresholds, production/development scope and
    pull-request checks for introduced dependency risk.<br>
    https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-audit/<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-your-supply-chain/manage-your-dependency-security/configure-dependency-review-action

75. **GitHub protected-environment review controls** — required human review,
    optional prevention of initiator self-review, delayed secret access and
    auditable deployment approval.<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/deployments-and-environments<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/deploy/configure-and-manage-deployments/review-deployments

76. **GitHub signed-tag guidance** — SSH/GPG/S/MIME tag signing, local
    cryptographic verification and GitHub's verified-tag status.<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-tags<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification

77. **GitHub issue-form and pull-request-template guidance** — structured
    contributor inputs, issue chooser configuration and default-branch template
    placement.<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates

78. **npm package metadata and `publishConfig` guidance** — `description` and
    `keywords` support discovery; `funding` has an actionable `npm fund`
    meaning; publish-time registry/access/tag configuration can defend the
    intended channel; direct and staged publication accept explicit tags, and a
    staged candidate's tag is immutable through approval.<br>
    https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json/<br>
    https://docs.npmjs.com/staged-publishing/<br>
    https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-stage/

79. **GitHub Actions retention and immutable-release evidence guidance** —
    public workflow artifacts/logs have bounded retention, whereas immutable
    release assets and the automatic release attestation protect a durable
    publication snapshot.<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/configuring-the-retention-period-for-github-actions-artifacts-and-logs-in-your-organization<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/workflows-and-actions/workflow-artifacts<br>

    https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-your-dependencies/verify-release-integrity

80. **GitHub CodeQL default setup and merge protection guidance** — JavaScript
    requires no special build configuration under default setup, and rulesets
    can block missing/incomplete analysis or findings at configured severity.<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/how-tos/find-and-fix-code-vulnerabilities/configure-code-scanning/configure-code-scanning<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/concepts/code-scanning/merge-protection

81. **GitHub secret scanning and push-protection guidance** — public-repository
    detection, pre-push blocking, bypass evidence and required handling of real
    exposed credentials.<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/concepts/secret-security/about-alerts<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/concepts/secret-security/push-protection

82. **Node.js package entry-point guidance** — `exports` is the recommended
    modern entry authority for supported Node versions, explicitly encapsulates
    unlisted subpaths and takes precedence over the older `main` fallback.<br>
    https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#package-entry-points

83. **webpack package-side-effect guidance** — `sideEffects: false` permits
    whole unused module subtrees to be removed and is unsafe when import-time
    initialization is actually required.<br>
    https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/#mark-the-file-as-side-effect-free

84. **npm `devEngines` guidance** — source-repository runtime/package-manager
    checks run before npm install/CI/run operations and are distinct from the
    package-consumer `engines` contract.<br>
    https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json/#devengines

84a. **Node.js release archives** — authoritative release identities and
     signed checksum material for the exact blocking `22.23.2` and `24.19.0`
     workflow runtimes.<br>
     https://nodejs.org/download/release/v22.23.2/<br>
     https://nodejs.org/download/release/v24.19.0/

84b. **npm `12.0.2` registry record** — exact package-manager release selected
     for `devEngines`, lockfile generation and every npm CI/release operation.<br>
     https://registry.npmjs.org/npm/12.0.2

85. **JSPM Generator 2.16.3 documentation** — exact import-map generation,
    local linking, provider/environment selection and integrity-bearing map
    output.<br>
    https://registry.npmjs.org/@jspm/generator/2.16.3<br>
    https://jspm.org/docs/generator/<br>
    https://jspm.org/docs/generator/interfaces/GeneratorOptions.html

86. **CycloneDX npm SBOM generator 6.0.1** — installed npm-graph collection,
    production omission, CycloneDX 1.6 JSON, reproducible output, validation,
    library-root options and external-subject invocation used by the separated
    tool/subject release gate.<br>
    https://registry.npmjs.org/@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm/6.0.1<br>
    https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-node-npm

87. **JSON Schema Draft 2020-12, Ajv 8.20.0 and `ajv-formats` 3.0.1** —
    versioned schema vocabulary, the dedicated Ajv Draft 2020-12 validator mode
    and explicit standard URI/date-time format implementations for repository/
    release evidence.<br>
    https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12<br>
    https://ajv.js.org/json-schema.html<br>
    https://ajv.js.org/guide/formats.html<br>
    https://registry.npmjs.org/ajv/8.20.0<br>
    https://registry.npmjs.org/ajv-formats/3.0.1

88. **npm lockfile and published dependency-resolution guidance** — repository
    `package-lock.json` files describe a repeatable source/CI tree, cannot be
    published and are ignored below the consumer root; publishable
    `npm-shrinkwrap.json` files can define the dependency tree from the point
    encountered, but npm does not recommend them for reusable libraries.<br>
    https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/configuring-npm/package-lock-json/<br>
    https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/configuring-npm/npm-shrinkwrap-json/

89. **npm dependency-field guidance** — ordinary, peer, optional, bundled and
    override dependencies have distinct consumer-resolution semantics; root
    overrides are not a reusable installed-package policy substitute.<br>
    https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json/#dependencies

90. **publint package/tarball validation** — `0.3.24` is the present exact
    baseline; direct tarball input, strict warning handling and resolver/
    metadata/file-publication rules are used as the independent package-lint
    gate.<br>
    https://registry.npmjs.org/publint/0.3.24<br>
    https://publint.dev/docs/cli<br>
    https://publint.dev/rules

90a. **`semver` 7.8.5** — exact SemVer parsing/range/prerelease authority used
     by the version/channel gate rather than project-owned approximation.<br>
     https://registry.npmjs.org/semver/7.8.5<br>
     https://github.com/npm/node-semver

90b. **Playwright Test 1.62.1 and managed browsers** — exact test package plus
     its coupled Chromium, Firefox and WebKit installation/execution model used
     by the blocking browser evidence matrix.<br>
     https://registry.npmjs.org/@playwright/test/1.62.1<br>
     https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers

90c. **Vite 8.2.2** — exact standalone browser/worker consumer-fixture bundler;
     WebVOWL's independent lockfile remains a separate consumer authority.<br>
     https://registry.npmjs.org/vite/8.2.2<br>
     https://vite.dev/guide/

91. **SPDX licence-information guidance** — standardized identifiers,
    expressions, canonical licence identities and the distinction between
    licensing information and copyright notices.<br>
    https://spdx.dev/learn/handling-license-info/

92. **REUSE Specification 3.3** — distribution/file-oriented preservation of
    licensing information and corresponding licence material.<br>
    https://reuse.software/spec/

93. **npm provenance and signature verification** — provenance/publish
    attestations, Sigstore transparency evidence and the attestation-bearing
    `npm audit signatures --json --include-attestations` result.<br>
    https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements/<br>
    https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-audit/#audit-signatures

94. **GitHub immutable-release and GitHub CLI 2.98.0 verification guidance** —
    automatic tag/commit/asset release attestations plus the exact checksummed
    CLI providing separate `gh release verify` and `gh release verify-asset`
    commands.<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/concepts/supply-chain-security/immutable-releases<br>
    https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-your-supply-chain/secure-your-dependencies/verify-release-integrity<br>

## 33. Final Recommendation

Proceed with the extraction, but **replace the original “all parsers emit triples and `OWLOntology` indexes them” design before implementation begins**.

The final architectural rules are:

> **OWL syntax front ends construct OWL. RDF syntax front ends construct RDF. A single standards-based mapping layer connects the two. WebVOWL consumes OWL and knows nothing about syntax.**

> **The new production core is independently implemented from normative/public specifications and project-owned compatibility evidence. Java OWLAPI is a pinned behavioural oracle and development-time reference, not a source-to-source implementation template or runtime dependency.**

> **The complete finite v1 ontology-ingestion programme is WIP-locked to one major migration at a time. Every completed parser/adapter/ingestion-hardening phase verifies, integrates, learns, institutionalizes and hands off before the next begins. There is no later parallel parser-migration mode.**

> **Implementation discretion is constrained by modern JavaScript engineering best practice, the repository's engineering standards and the normative logical/module boundaries in this plan. The initial `owlapi` release line remains native ESM JavaScript with no TypeScript/`tsc`/`checkJs` requirement.**

> **The canonical repository root is also the package root: the retained tarball installs one readable native-ESM production tree directly, with no duplicate `src/`→`dist/` build, generated/minified code, source maps or automatic install/pack/publish hooks. It ships the version-matched README, exhaustive API reference, human changelog, licence, notice and compatibility registries, but no official TypeScript declarations or `types`/`typings` claim for `0.1.0-alpha.0` or `0.1.0`.**

> **One unconditional `exports` map is the sole package-entry authority: `.`, `./apibinding`, `./model`, `./io` and `./formats` point directly to their canonical `index.js` modules. There is no `main`, `module`, `browser`, condition, wildcard, extension alias, `./package.json` export or deep-path escape hatch. Root/subpath re-exports preserve binding identity and every representative alternate spelling fails.**

> **Every package-owned production module is pure on import and the manifest therefore requires `sideEffects: false`. Fresh-process instrumentation and optimized used/unused consumer builds prove that import performs no registration, I/O or global mutation and that tree shaking preserves required behaviour. A failure is corrected in source rather than hidden by weakening the metadata.**

> **The first production release environment contract is explicit: `engines.node` is `^22.0.0 || ^24.0.0`; Phase 19 fixes blocking Node `22.23.2` and `24.19.0`, with `24.19.0` alone producing releases; and Node 26 remains a non-blocking Current probe until its LTS promotion and separately approved matrix expansion. Alpha tracks moving `baseline widely available`; production `0.1.0` freezes the 0.1.x feature ceiling to the actual dated Baseline query with its resolved data inputs. Package source is neither transpiled nor polyfilled.**

> **Repository tooling uses npm-native `devEngines`: runtime name `node`, package-manager name `npm`, exact version `12.0.2` and `onFail: error`. npm `12.0.2` creates the lockfile and runs every CI/release npm operation. Every npm development tool is exact in the manifest, installed by lockfile-backed `npm ci` and invoked through a named local `npm run` script; remote `npx`, `npm exec --package`, global development tools and runner-preinstalled release tools are forbidden. `engines.npm`, top-level `packageManager`, Corepack and floating CLI tags are absent because npm tool identity is not a consumer-runtime promise or a second package-manager authority.**

> **Browser bundlers and native document ESM with an application-owned import map are complementary supported paths over the same five public exports. Exact `@jspm/generator@2.16.3` uses `jspm.io`, `production`/`browser`/`module` and integrity metadata to generate the version-pinned reference; public URLs are verified and an untransformed integrity-checked local mirror executes OWL-native, RDF/XML, Turtle and JSON-LD paths through exact `@playwright/test@1.62.1` and its managed Chromium, Firefox and WebKit revisions. Exact `vite@8.2.2` builds the package's bundler/worker fixtures, while WebVOWL retains its independently accepted lockfile toolchain. The provider remains replaceable reference infrastructure, not package runtime. Import maps do not apply to workers; bundled dedicated-worker ingestion is a separate required path. No `es-module-shims`, CommonJS, IIFE, universal package-owned map, environment-conditioned export or turnkey CDN build is introduced.**

> **npm is the authoritative install, lock, audit, pack, publish and provenance workflow. Yarn and pnpm are `PLAUSIBLE_UNVERIFIED` while genuine package-metadata defects they expose remain actionable. Bun, Deno, Cloudflare Workers, React Native, Electron-specific integration and CommonJS are `OUT_OF_SCOPE` for `0.1.0`; the README distinguishes those statuses from the exact `SUPPORTED` Node, browser-document and bundled-dedicated-worker paths.**

> **The six exact runtime packages remain ordinary library `dependencies`. `package-lock.json` governs source/CI/release construction but is not published; no shrinkwrap, bundled, peer, optional or override dependency authority enters the manifest/tarball. Every candidate records both its locked SBOM graph and a cache-empty lockless consumer resolution, while a read-only weekly `owlapi@latest` monitor detects later transitive drift without changing source, tags or releases.**

> **Exact-pinned `publint@0.3.24` is the present independent package-lint baseline; a later exact version is permitted only after the same tool-update review, never through a floating range or tag. It checks the retained and registry-downloaded tarballs in strict mode. Project-specific export, packlist, identity, semantic and browser gates remain authoritative for deliberate `owlapi` contracts; only an exact-tool/rule/version, evidence-backed, expiring warning exception may qualify a generic lint disagreement.**

> **The public package is the unscoped npm package `owlapi`. Its intended first release is the useful, retained `owlapi@0.1.0-alpha.0` prerelease under `next`, published from one reviewed and consumer-tested tarball. The seven exact coordinates in the unrelated fully unpublished history are never reused. Production-recommended `0.1.0` is the documented normal first Hadden Industries release—not a patch of the former `1.0.0` and not a SemVer-stable API—and `latest` remains unset until its separately accepted production gate. Solely if §2.60 requires an immutable post-tag/prepublication abandonment, the next prerelease or same-surface production patch becomes the first public release at that level. Otherwise compatible corrections use available `0.1.x` patches beginning with `0.1.1`; the ontology-lifecycle programme normally uses `0.2.0`, advancing if that coordinate is consumed first; and no later zero-major or post-zero coordinate is reserved.**

> **Distribution tags name active channels rather than preserve history. Alpha and release candidates use `next`; production `0.1.0` first establishes `latest`; after production verification, the obsolete `next` pointer is removed rather than left on an older RC or duplicated onto production. Every tag change is separately authorized, recorded and verified, and `next` returns only with a genuine newer prerelease. Only the bad-release procedure may later move or remove `latest` to contain a defective production release.**

> **The reviewed manifest and registry operation redundantly name the same SemVer-derived channel. Every prerelease has `publishConfig.tag=next` and an explicit `--tag next`; every accepted production has `publishConfig.tag=latest` and an explicit `--tag latest`. Any disagreement among version, manifest, `npm-release` environment request, command or observed registry state blocks publication.**

> **npm discovery metadata is precise and stable: the package describes OWL 2 ontology parsing and structural APIs for Node.js/browsers with practical Java OWLAPI conceptual compatibility, and uses the approved OWL/ontology/RDF-focused keywords. It does not claim a reasoner, knowledge-graph platform or WebVOWL-specific identity, and does not fill `funding`, contributor, maintainer or author-email fields without a real semantic purpose.**

> **At `0.1.0`, the five public specifiers, registry-classified bindings, documented call/structural/error contracts and declared semantic capabilities become the protected 0.1 contract. Unexported paths, dependencies and incidental representations do not. Deprecations remain operational and silent throughout their current 0.minor patch line; compatible corrections are patches only when they restore rather than contradict the documented contract; and material additions or incompatible protected-surface changes require the next available zero-minor boundary. Every zero-minor is treated as a deliberate compatibility boundary while the API remains in initial development.**

> **Before production `0.1.0`, dated registry evidence refreshes the package identity and every known immutable coordinate; an unexpected conflict blocks publication for a separately approved version decision. Ordinary former 1.x and 2.x ranges cannot select the new 0.x line. The comprehensive exact/range consumer audit is deferred until a separately authorized post-zero stability-promotion decision, which may then choose an available coordinate such as `1.0.1` or the more isolated `3.0.0`; neither is reserved here.**

> **The sole canonical source and release repository is the independent public `Hadden-Industries/owlapi` repository. It is not a GitHub fork or mirror of WebVOWL. Its relevant lineage is preserved through a reviewed migration-only history extraction using digest-recorded `git-filter-repo@2.47.0`, a complete original-to-rewritten commit map and file-hash evidence; unrelated UI/UX work is reconstructed separately in `Hadden-Industries/webvowl`.**

> **That repository uses one protected `main` trunk, short-lived pull requests and squash-only curated commits. Required checks, resolved conversations, linear history, `MaksymShostak` administrator coverage and a narrow auditable bypass apply immediately; no second-person approval is required anywhere in this implementation plan. A future independent-review rule requires a separately approved post-plan governance/configuration change. A separate `v*` ruleset makes release tags immutable, while SSH-signed annotated release tags—not a blanket signed-commit rule—anchor release source.**

> **Every public version is human-authored in a dedicated release pull request that reconciles the exact version, changelog, API, compatibility metadata and evidence. Release automation verifies the accepted squash commit, creates no tracked change/commit/tag or improvised notes, and manually dispatches one retained-artefact chain at that protected-`main` commit. It completes all deterministic gates—and steady-state stage/download byte proof—before the human creates the canonical SSH-signed tag, then verifies that tag before draft/public promotion. Heavy release-authoring frameworks and mandatory Conventional Commits are deferred until actual release volume justifies them.**

> **GitHub Actions uses exactly four trust-separated workflow files: read-only `ci.yml`, protected-`main` manually dispatched late-tag `release.yml`, `maintenance.yml` and non-blocking `extended-tests.yml`. Each denies token authority at its root and grants only job-minimal permissions. One serialized, non-cancelling, cache-free `release.yml` run owns the complete retained candidate; npm OIDC, no-authority `release-manual` review jobs, GitHub-release writes and maintenance issue writes remain separate. Privileged `pull_request_target`/`workflow_run`, cross-workflow candidate promotion, runner-based human-wait polling, external reusable workflows, floating Actions and unselected Action repositories are forbidden.**

> **Exactly five GitHub-maintained Action releases are executable, each by the §2.56 full SHA with its reviewed tag beside it: checkout v7.0.1, setup-node v7.0.0, upload-artifact v7.0.1, download-artifact v8.0.1 and dependency-review-action v5.0.0. Checkout never persists credentials; setup-node uses literal Node patches with both implicit and explicit dependency caching disabled; steady OIDC publication performs no checkout and receives no registry/token setup; the three-file candidate is uploaded once, recorded and downloaded by immutable artefact ID with closed inventory and independent hashes; dependency review is read-only and blocks only introduced high/critical runtime vulnerabilities. Cache, script, publish, release, SBOM, provenance and attestation wrapper Actions are absent. An update proposal must revalidate the tag-to-SHA mapping and every relevant runtime/default/input/output/permission behavior, never merely replace a hash.**

> **Required automation uses only explicit GA `ubuntu-24.04` x64, `windows-2025` x64 and `macos-15` arm64 hosted labels. Ubuntu alone builds and publishes; its complete Node 22/24 suite is joined by four blocking Windows/macOS installed-tarball lanes and three separate one-worker, cache-free Ubuntu Playwright-engine jobs. Linux/macOS use explicit Bash, Windows uses PowerShell Core, and substantive policy stays in cross-platform `.mjs` scripts. Each job validates and records the requested label, OS/architecture, mutable GitHub image version, OS/kernel and actual runtime/browser identities. Moving/latest, preview, slim, larger, self-hosted and container runners are absent, as is every runner-preinstalled release tool.**

> **Automation fails closed through two governance-verified stable aggregates: the GitHub-Actions-owned `CI / required` check plus separate CodeQL protects `main`, and the protected npm job directly needs `Release / qualified`. Every required matrix uses `fail-fast: false` without allow-failure or swallowed status; every job/critical step has its exact timeout; release concurrency is non-cancelling `queue: max`, while CI cancels only superseded work and observational schedules coalesce only pending runs. Bounded retries apply solely to classified idempotent reads. Every npm/GitHub/issue/Git-ref write receives one automatic attempt; an ambiguous response is reconciled read-only against exact remote identity and digest, and any genuinely new mutation requires renewed explicit authorization.**

> **Every external contributor's fork-workflow run requires per-run maintainer approval after inspection of all executable inputs, but that click authorizes only unprivileged compute. External and Dependabot code runs solely through read-only, no-secret/no-OIDC/no-environment `pull_request` CI; its candidate is quarantined to unprivileged jobs in that same run and can never enter release. Contributor/external strings are validated as data rather than interpolated into shell or written raw to workflow-command files. Credential jobs prohibit context dumps, tracing and authentication debug output; automatic masking is defense in depth, and suspected exposure triggers immediate revoke/rotate and sanitized incident handling.**

> **Every public version is one retained GitHub-Actions-built tarball plus a validated reproducible CycloneDX 1.6 JSON library SBOM and an exact sorted two-entry `SHA256SUMS`. Exact `@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm@6.0.1` runs from a full tool workspace against a separate production-only subject workspace; independent npm/lockfile/pack inventories confirm its unflattened/full-PURL graph. The same tarball passes exact Node, `@playwright/test@1.62.1` Chromium/Firefox/WebKit and independently tooled WebVOWL consumer gates, is published to npm with provenance, is re-downloaded and verified from a fresh cache, and only then joins a machine-readable release-evidence manifest in the published immutable GitHub release. Exact `ajv@8.20.0` plus `ajv-formats@3.0.1` validates every evidence family; exact npm attestation JSON proves the root coordinate's signature, subject, repository/workflow and transparency identity; and checksum-verified GitHub CLI `2.98.0` verifies the immutable release plus each of four freshly downloaded assets and the independent signed tag. A repository-only append-only record preserves those identities and later dated extended evidence; 90-day Actions logs/artifacts are diagnostic, not canonical, and immutable release attestation replaces a redundant detached evidence signature. The bootstrap alpha uses a one-day, single-attempt, immediately revoked granular token with its real effective scope recorded. Subsequent releases use stage-only OIDC: npm's staged tarball is downloaded and required to match the retained SHA-256 before interactive approval, automatic provenance replaces an explicit provenance flag, traditional token publishing is disabled, and no redundant attestation step is added.**

> **The named `maksymshostak` npm account performs the unscoped-coordinate bootstrap and remains the sole natural-person npm custodian required through this implementation plan. The project then empirically tests `@hadden-industries:owlapi-maintainers` team access and records rather than assumes the result, but does not misrepresent a one-person team as human redundancy. Shared npm logins are prohibited; subsequent publication is limited to the exact `Hadden-Industries/owlapi`/`.github/workflows/release.yml`/`npm-release` stage-only OIDC trusted publisher with traditional publication tokens disabled. The bootstrap token and secret are revoked/deleted and the dead workflow branch is removed before that transition. Every staged candidate is identified, inspected, downloaded, revalidated and matched byte-for-byte to the retained tarball before Maksym Shostak approves that exact stage with interactive 2FA. The plan knowingly accepts sole-custodian availability and recovery risk; adding another human custodian is post-plan governance.**

> **All six semantic runtime foundations are exact-pinned in the initial manifest and source lockfile: `@rdfjs/data-model@2.1.2`, `@rdfjs/dataset@2.0.3`, `@xmldom/xmldom@0.9.12`, `jsonld@9.0.0`, `n3@2.3.0` and `rdfxml-streaming-parser@3.3.0`. The three advances from the earlier staging pins were qualified together in WebVOWL on 24 August 2026 through one explicitly approved combined gate that retained dependency-specific evidence; Phase 19 carries that proven baseline forward. Dependabot supplies weekly and security proposals, not auto-merges: every later foundational runtime update is isolated and fully gated, compatible development tooling may be grouped, major tooling and full-SHA Action updates remain separately reviewable, and no parallel Renovate authority is introduced.**

> **Every candidate retains a full dependency-graph audit and passes the high/critical production threshold; pull requests receive the exact §2.56 full-SHA dependency-review Action with runtime scope, high severity, read-only/no-comment policy and no Action-level licence gate. Reachable critical findings cannot be waived, false-positive/non-applicability exceptions are machine-readable and expire within 30 days, release-path development findings block, and no automatic audit fix mutates reviewed inputs.**

> **The public repository enables CodeQL JavaScript default setup/default queries, requires complete high/critical code-scanning results on `main`, and separately retains dependency review. Secret scanning and push protection prevent supported credentials entering public history; a real exposure is rotated/revoked as an incident. Source-analysis exceptions are distinct, machine-readable and expire within 30 days, while reachable critical findings have no ordinary waiver.**

> **A bad public release is contained without rewriting history: deprecate its exact coordinate, roll back or remove its active distribution tag, and publish a fully gated corrective version. Unpublish is reserved for separately authorized confidentiality, malware, legal or registry-directed incidents. `0.1.0` remains the normal required first production release; only §2.60's extraordinary immutable post-tag/prepublication abandonment may make `0.1.1` the first production release, while only a mandatory post-publication failure may make the first corrective patch the production-verified cutover consumed by WebVOWL.**

> **The protected `npm-release` environment permits only protected `main`, because the manually dispatched run precedes the canonical tag, and always requires explicit human approval of the exact registry operation. The separate `release-manual` environment also permits only protected `main`, but has no secret, variable, custom rule, OIDC or write authority and is always referenced with `deployment: false`: it admits `Release / tag accepted` after human tag creation and, for staged publication, `Release / publication confirmed` after interactive 2FA promotion. The initiating named custodian may approve all three human boundaries during this programme; authenticated review history is retained, no runner polls while waiting, and prevent-self-review/independent deployment approval remain deliberately unnecessary until a separately approved threat-model change.**

> **Release tags use SSH and a repository-only versioned authorized-signer registry. The workflow verifies the annotated tag locally, its already-admitted signer, exact protected-`main` target and GitHub verification result. Human private keys never enter CI; OIDC publication authority remains a distinct control.**

> **Ordinary public intake uses GitHub Issues with six structured forms and an engineering-focused pull-request template. Blank issues and Discussions are disabled, no generic support mailbox is created, security and conduct retain their private role addresses, and `CODEOWNERS` waits for genuine ownership/review routing.**

> **`owlapi` is zero-telemetry: installation, import, manager creation, local parsing and diagnostics make no outbound request or automatic report. Only explicitly enabled ontology-import or JSON-LD-context resolution may retrieve a caller-requested document through the bounded loader/security policy. The installed dependency closure is tested so a transitive package cannot silently weaken that promise.**

> **Security reports use GitHub private vulnerability reporting first and `security@haddenindustries.com` second, never a public issue or the conduct channel. The project aims to acknowledge reports within five working days without offering an SLA, supports only the current `next` prerelease before production and the latest production 0.1.x afterward, and preserves every release-integrity gate for security fixes.**

> **Contributor Covenant 3.0 governs repository conduct separately from contribution licensing and vulnerability disclosure. Maksym Shostak is the sole HADDEN INDUSTRIES LTD-appointed moderator required by this plan; reports go privately to `conduct@haddenindustries.com`, he may not adjudicate a report in which he is materially conflicted, and the policy honestly discloses that any independent substitute requires separately governed post-plan appointment. A second moderator is not a publication gate, and the repository-only Code of Conduct is excluded from the npm tarball.**

> **`owlapi` is licensed under `AGPL-3.0-only` to require strong, network-aware source reciprocity. The choice is deliberate rather than inherited from avoidable implementation provenance; WebVOWL remains AGPL-3.0-only while package and application licensing scopes are documented separately. Any future more-permissive release requires demonstrable authority over every included contribution and does not revoke rights in earlier AGPL releases.**

> **A schema-validated, human-reviewed third-party-material registry records the exact production graph, release-relevant development material, copied/generated third-party files, inspected licence/notice-file hashes, SPDX expressions, relationships and distribution scopes. The package `NOTICE` covers material actually distributed in the `owlapi` tarball and identifies ordinary external dependency boundaries; WebVOWL separately reconciles the code physically embedded into its emitted application bundle and preserves that distribution's applicable notices.**

> **Maksym Shostak retains personal copyright in his existing `owlapi` contributions and is identified as their owner until any optional written assignment actually takes effect. HADDEN INDUSTRIES LTD, registered in England and Wales under company number 07862561, is identified separately as project steward. Assignment and private estate planning are not alpha, production-release or plan-completion gates. This plan requires accurate tarball-scoped rights evidence and verified sole `MaksymShostak`/`maksymshostak` operational authority, explicitly accepts the resulting single-person availability/recovery risk, and does not claim that company stewardship supplies human account continuity.**

> **The initial outside-contribution model is `AGPL-3.0-only` inbound=outbound with contributor-retained copyright. Phase 19 publishes that policy but does not create speculative CLA administration before an external copyrightable contribution exists. Before the first such contribution is merged, the project must separately approve either continued pure inbound=outbound—accepting contributor-by-contributor consent for later permissive relicensing—or a reviewed contributor-retained CLA that grants the selected additional authority before merge.**

> **`0.1.0-alpha.0` is the intended package of the accepted Phase 18 capability surface; Phase 19 does not absorb new semantic APIs. Phase 20 qualifies that same capability family, verifies a `0.1.0` release candidate and normally publishes production-recommended initial-development `0.1.0`; WebVOWL normally consumes that exact version, while only §2.60's prepublication immutable-tag contingency or an activated §2.33 bad-release branch permits the applicable same-surface patch to become its production cutover. Imports-closure queries, mutation, merger, saving, Functional Syntax storage and RDF/XML storage belong to the separate ontology-lifecycle capability plan and normally target `0.2.0`, or the next available zero-minor if an intervening incompatible correction consumes that coordinate.**

> **Complete W3C result ledgers, EARL generation, layered-implementation eligibility consultation and optional upstream implementation-report submissions belong to the separate `w3c-test-conformance-reporting-implementation-plan.md`. That programme begins only after this plan completes and no response, submission, merge or publication under it gates `owlapi@0.1.0` or WebVOWL's registry-package cutover.**

> **The package README explains why `owlapi` was built: no evaluated adjacent implementation satisfied the complete JavaScript/browser, structural-OWL, syntax/mapping and OWL2VOWL access requirements, while the difficult work extended well beyond raw RDF parsing. It also states the independent Java OWLAPI relationship and the alpha's exact limits.**

> **The Public API Surface Registry is the release-versioned Java compatibility and gap authority. Except for the bare aggregate, every public npm subpath maps exactly to an approved `org.semanticweb.owlapi` package; a Java package's existence is necessary but does not itself authorize exposure. Public bindings have one canonical definition in the matching Java-shaped namespace. Private engines use cohesive JavaScript-oriented `internal/` ownership and are never duplicated into a mirrored public-package tree.**

> **WebVOWL is a required first-party consumer of `owlapi`: its production code, tests and builds use an exact npm-registry dependency and only the applicable declared `owlapi`, `owlapi/apibinding`, `owlapi/model`, `owlapi/io` and `owlapi/formats` package specifiers. RDF translators/factories are internal. Relative source-tree imports, workspaces/local dependencies, `owlapi/rdf`, unexported deep imports and resolver aliases that bypass package `exports` are forbidden.**

KRSS1 and KRSS2 are distinct required parser/format surfaces implemented through separate adapters over only genuinely shared KRSS machinery. Phase 17 completes original KRSS/KRSS1 and records that no qualifying public first-party historical KRSS1/KRSS2 corpus was verified. N3.js is the selected parser library for the four standard RDF syntaxes above; each has an independent strict descriptor and phase, while broader N3-language ingestion is independently `DEFERRED`.

The plan may reorder future not-yet-started phases only through the approved project-decision process and corresponding normative-document updates; reordering never removes the one-at-a-time ingestion WIP lock.

This architecture and delivery contract provides:

- W3C structural and RDF grounding;
- a canonical OWL structural model and lossless RDF/JS dataset boundary;
- explicit graph-policy semantics;
- deterministic parser detection/fallback and transactional parsing;
- standards-first conformance governance;
- precise machine-readable differential exceptions rather than tolerances;
- finite resource/security limits and measurable performance budgets;
- selected but replaceable standards-parser dependencies;
- Java OWLAPI behavioural compatibility without source transliteration;
- explicit provenance dispositions;
- independently governed canonical package source with traceable migration-only
  history and no duplicated maintained WebVOWL tree;
- modern native-JavaScript engineering without TypeScript tooling;
- continuous first-party verification of the public package boundary by
  WebVOWL itself;
- immutable bad-release recovery, severity/reachability-aware dependency gates,
  explicit human publication approval, governed SSH release signing and
  structured public intake;
- version/channel-consistent and honestly discoverable package metadata,
  durable release-evidence manifests, CodeQL/secret protection and a tested
  zero-telemetry contract;
- a sole explicit entry-point map, verified import purity, exact npm source
  tooling, integrity-mirrored reference import maps, independently reconciled
  CycloneDX 1.6 SBOMs and Draft 2020-12-validated evidence; and
- cumulative sequential migration learning with deterministic handoff.

Most importantly, it makes `owlapi` a genuine **OWL abstraction**, not merely a relocated collection of format converters.
