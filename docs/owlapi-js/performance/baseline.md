# Phase 0 baseline

- WebVOWL revision: `5301d6c0b9e69c048f6ab079ea1103790bc70b85`
- Environment: Windows 11 x64, Node.js `v24.17.0`.
- Test command: `npm test -- --runInBand`
- Result on 9 August 2026: 48 suites passed, 398 tests passed.
- Differential runner: passed but emitted differences for 44 reference fixtures.
  Those diagnostics are characterization evidence, not approved expected-difference rules.
- Measured source corpus: `C:/Users/maksy/GitHub/universal-ontology/src/external`.
- Largest measured ontology: `schemaorg.owl`, 1,987,111 bytes.
- Existing documented failure class: eager tokenization of unrelated input around 2 MiB can exhaust V8 heap.
- Pinned benchmark inventory: `performance/benchmark-corpus.json`.
- Measurement protocol: one warm-up plus five measured runs, reporting the median.
- Release threshold: at most 20% regression in median wall time and peak heap
  relative to the last accepted phase baseline, unless the repository decision
  authority approves evidence and rationale for a new baseline.

A phase may establish a new accepted baseline only after its full Definition of
Done passes. A regression is not grounds to rewrite this baseline.
