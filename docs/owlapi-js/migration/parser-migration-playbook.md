# Parser migration playbook

This file is the current method for the next migration. Rewrite obsolete advice;
do not append chronology here.

## Pre-flight

1. Confirm the prior ingestion learning gate is closed and only one ingestion migration is active.
2. Consult `provenance/provenance.json` before reading or changing legacy code.
3. Enumerate the public grammar and the OWLAPI parser/factory/format identity.
4. Map every required production to a structural `OWLDataFactory` constructor.
5. Write focused tests at the new abstraction boundary before correcting behavior.

## Implementation

- Parse OWL-native syntax directly into immutable structural OWL objects.
- Keep lazy tokenization and bounded lookahead; enforce the shared resource budget early.
- Preserve operand category, arity, optionality, and ordered-vs-unordered semantics.
- Preserve IRIs, literals, language/datatype, annotations, and anonymous individuals end to end.
- Use only canonical `kind` dispatch. Unknown supported-category kinds fail deterministically.
- Throw typed errors for unsupported constructs. Never use silent `null`, fallback values, or broad catch-and-continue.
- Parse into isolated transaction state; commit only after accepted success.

## Verification and handoff

1. Run focused model/parser tests, structural snapshots, Java differential fixtures, resource/adversarial tests, and the complete WebVOWL suite.
2. Record every material finding with evidence and one primary disposition.
3. Turn reusable findings into tests/contracts where deterministic.
4. Update this playbook and all impacted future phase assumptions.
5. Close the mechanically reviewable learning gate before activating the next ingestion phase.
